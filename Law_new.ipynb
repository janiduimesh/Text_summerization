TITLE: FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT TEXT: [*1] Plaintiff Susan Stocking brings this case on behalf of herself and all other women employed by AT&T Corp. (\"AT&T\") who have been discriminated against by their employer, AT&T, and its affiliated companies, and would show the Court as follows: I. Jurisdiction, Venue, and Parties\\n1. Plaintiff Susan Stocking is a citizen of the state of Missouri, was employed by Defendant, and has filed an EEOC complaint and obtained the right to sue. See attached Decision (attached as \"Exhibit A\") and right-to-sue letter (attached as \"Exhibit B\").\\n2. AT&T employs Plaintiff and thousands [**2] of other women like her. AT&T is a citizen of the states of New\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *1; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **2\\n\\nPage 2\\n\\nYork where it is incorporated and of New Jersey where its principal place of business is located; and can be served with service of process at The Corporation Company, Inc., 515 S. Kansas Ave., Topeka, KS 66603.\\n3. Aetna Insurance Company (\"Health Insurer\") was a health insurer for Plaintiff and/or AT&T.\\n[*2] 4. Venue is proper in this Court as Defendant does business in this judicial district and has offered or provided health insurance to its employees in this judicial district. 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b) and (c); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e 5(f)(3).\\n5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction based on federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e - 5(f)(3).\\nA. Summary of Claims\\n6. Prescription medication related to reproduction is routinely covered for men, but not for women. Prescription contraception, which is used only by women, is a basic prescription medication related to reproduction; specifically, it prevents pregnancy for women who wish to do so by reversible means. Plaintiff, on [**3] behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, brings this class action against AT&T for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k) for offering and/or providing health insurance that does not cover prescription contraceptives for women related to reproduction while covering sex-related prescription medication for men, such as Viagra.\\n7. AT&T\\'s exclusion of prescription contraception has an adverse disparate impact on Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class. Because prescription contraceptives are available for use only by women, AT&T\\'s failure to provide coverage for prescription contraception forces its female employees to choose between paying their own out-of-pocket prescription costs, or bearing the physical, emotional and financial costs of an unplanned pregnancy.\\n8. As a result of AT&T decision to exclude contraceptives from its benefits plan, Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class are being discriminated against in the [*3] terms and conditions of employment, [**4] which includes receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, because of their potential for pregnancy. This violates Title VII.\\nB. Plaintiff Susan Stocking\\n9. Plaintiff Susan Stocking has been employed by AT&T on a full-time basis since June 12, 1995. As part of the terms and conditions of her employment, Ms. Stocking receives health insurance coverage, including coverage of prescription drugs and devices. Ms. Stocking sues on her own behalf and as a representative of the proposed class of employees who are discriminated against by the exclusion of contraception from AT&T\\'s benefit plan.\\n10. Ms. Stocking was, at all times relevant to this cause of action, a woman of childbearing age who was concerned with the prevention of an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy. Ms. Stocking requested that her prescription health care benefit provide or reimburse her for the cost of birth control. Her requests were denied. Subsequently, Ms. Stocking learned that men were provided and received plan coverage of a full range of conditions that can be treated through prescription medication.\\n11. On August 26, 2002, Ms. Stocking filed a charge with the EEOC at its Kansas City Area Office [**5] in Kansas City, Kansas alleging that AT&T\\'s failure to provide her with health insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex.\\n12. As a result, Ms. Stocking received a decision and a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC (copies of which are attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and Exhibit B\").\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *3; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **5\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\n[*4] 13. On November 29, 2002, the EEOC issued a \"Determination\" to Plaintiff Susan Stocking, in which it considered AT&T\\'s benefit plan and concluded that:\\n\"...it is the Commission\\'s position that the pre-July 2002 exclusion violates both Title VII and the PDA, since the statutes cover prescription contraceptives regardless of their intended purpose. Prescription contraceptives are available only for women. As a result, Respondent\\'s pre-July 2002 policy is, by definition, a sex-based exclusion...It appears that Respondent\\'s current plan uniquely classifies contraceptives used for birth control purposes by requiring their acquisition solely by mail. This also represents a sex-based distinction and violates the statutes. Coverage for prescription contraceptives must be afforded in the same manner as if the woman, or any employee, [**6] sought other preventive or health maintenance services.\\n14. AT&T\\'s refusal to provide the same benefits to both men and women has caused an economic hardship on Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class that male employees are not required to endure.\\nII. AT&T\\'s Health Plan\\n15. As terms and conditions of their employment, AT&T offered Ms. Stocking the opportunity to enroll in one of three health plans (Plan). The three options were: Post of Service (POS) option; Traditional Indemnity option (PPO); and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). The POS offered the highest level of benefits. The PPO option was only offered to those employees who lived outside the POS service area, but allowed selection of physicians and reimbursement after the deductible was met. The HMO option generally had no deductibles to meet, a small co-payment but required participants to see a doctor in the HMO network.\\n16. Regular full-time occupational employees are eligible for coverage at the company\\'s expense on the first day of the month in which the employee attains six months of Net Certified Service with AT&T. Regular full-time employees are not required to contribute to receive [**7] Plan benefits, but with the HMO option, they may be required to do so.\\n[*5] 17. Ms. Stocking elected to take advantage of the PPO option.\\n18. The Plan also provides for a Prescription Drug Benefit Plan which was administered by Merck-Medco (Drug Plan). The Drug Plan provided drug benefits to participants in the POS and PPO options. In general, the Drug Plan covered all drugs provided by a pharmacist at the physician\\'s order unless specifically excluded. The Drug Plan specifically excluded \"[a]ny drugs or medications used solely for birth control, including oral contraceptives, jellies, foams, devices, implants or injections.\"\\n19. Despite covering other preventative medical services and prescriptions, neither the Plan nor the Drug Plan provided for prescription drugs and/or devices used by plaintiffs and other women similarly situated to prevent pregnancy.\\n20. If plaintiff became pregnant, however, the Plan would have covered the costs of either an abortion or continuing the pregnancy to term - whichever she chose to do.\\nIII. Harm to Ms. Stocking and Other Class Members\\n21. As a direct and proximate result of the AT&T Plan\\'s failure to cover contraception [**8] to prevent pregnancy, Ms. Stocking and other proposed members of the class were required to pay for their monthly or periodic contraceptives on an out-of-pocket basis, or risk unintended pregnancy. Like many healthy women of reproductive age, contraception is the only prescription drug Ms. Stocking used on a regular and consistent basis.\\n22. On information and belief, AT&T employs hundreds of women of reproductive age who use prescription contraception.\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *5; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **8\\n\\nPage 4\\n\\n23. If contraception were treated on an equal basis with other prescriptions under the Plan and the Drug Plan, Ms. Stocking and other proposed class members would have paid a low co-pay, or no co-pay at all, for generic or brand-name, 34 day supply, of contraception.\\n[*6] IV. Factual Framework\\n24. For over thirty years of their lives, women have the biological potential for pregnancy. Contraception is a drug or device that prevents pregnancy. Without contraception, the average woman would be expected to have between 12 and 15 pregnancies in her lifetime. In any given year, 85 out of 100 sexually active women of reproductive age who do not use contraception will become pregnant. Most American women want only two [**9] children. To achieve that goal, the typical American woman spends roughly three decades - or about 75% of her reproductive life - trying to avoid unintended pregnancy. Of the 60.2 million women of reproductive age, 64% currently use contraception. Ninety-four percent of American women use contraception at some point during their reproductive years. Among all women aged 20-44 who have ever had sexual intercourse, 85% have used prescription oral contraceptives.\\n25. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved five methods of reversible prescription contraception: oral contraception; Norplant; Depo-Provera; intra-uterine device (\"IUD\"); and the diaphragm. Only women can use these methods of prescription contraception. Other forms of contraception are sold over the counter (OTC) and thus generally are not covered by health insurance. The OTC methods include the male condom and five female methods: spermicidal foam, jelly, film, suppositories and the female condom. All methods work either by preventing fertilization of a woman\\'s ovum or by preventing implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine wall.\\n26. Women bear all of the physical burdens of pregnancy, which are quite substantial. [**10] Pregnancy itself can put a woman\\'s life at risk. Ectopic pregnancy is the deadliest complication in the early stages of pregnancy. The three deadliest complications of full-term pregnancy are hemorrhage, hypertension and thrombosis. In the United States today, for every 100,000 births, [*7] 8-22 women (depending on their county of residence) die as a result of pregnancy-related complications.\\n27. Pregnancy also poses non-life threatening health risks for women. The morbidity rate during pregnancy is quite high. Twenty-two percent of all pregnant women are hospitalized before delivery because of various complications. Pre-term labor is one of the most common reasons women are hospitalized before delivery. In such instances, the medical interventions a woman must undergo often include long-term bed rest and administration of various drugs, some of which have significant side effects for the woman.\\n28. The more pregnancies she bears, the greater the likelihood a woman will suffer one or more of the myriad life and/or health-threatening complications of pregnancy. Women who experience a large number of pregnancies are known to be at far greater risk for certain permanent health [**11] problems such as uterine prolapse (downward displacement of the uterus so that some or all of the uterus comes outside of the vagina), rectocele (hernial protrusion of the rectum into the vagina), cystocele (hernial protrusion of the urinary bladder through the vaginal wall), pelvic floor disorders and varicose veins.\\n29. For women with pre-existing medical conditions, even one pregnancy can pose grave health risks. Preexisting medical conditions that are exacerbated by pregnancy include: certain blood diseases, including sickle-cell disease; heart disease; cancer; endocrine disorders such as diabetes; diseases of the nervous system such as epilepsy; kidney and liver diseases; connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; chronic hypertension; respiratory disease including asthma and pneumonia; and HIV present in the blood stream.\\n30. Unintended pregnancy poses far greater health risks to women and children than does intended pregnancy. The medical risks of unintended pregnancy are well documented. In [*8] general, women who become pregnant unexpectedly are less likely to receive adequate pre-natal care and thus have less opportunity [**12] to manage pre-existing medical conditions and other risks during pregnancy. For instance, unintended pregnancy is quite\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *8; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **12\\n\\nPage 5\\n\\ndangerous, and may even be deadly, for women with hypertension or diabetes. These conditions are best managed when medical care is begun before conception. In addition, women who become pregnant unexpectedly forego the opportunity to receive pre-conception counseling to improve the health of the fetus and are more likely to have low birth weight babies and experience a higher rate of neonatal mortality.\\n31. Unintended pregnancy is both frequent and widespread in the United States. Forty-nine percent of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Among Western Nations, the United States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy. Unintended pregnancy affects all segments of society. Four out of ten pregnancies among married women are unintended. Low-income women and unmarried women experience even higher rates of unintended pregnancy.\\n32. Contraception enables women to plan their pregnancies and time the spacing between pregnancies. The shorter the interval between her pregnancies, the greater the likelihood a woman will experience pre-term labor, [**13] depression and other health problems. Recognizing that contraception is central to the health and well-being of women and their children, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized that \"[s]maller families and longer birth intervals have contributed to the better health of infants, children, and women, and have improved the social and economic role of women.\"\\n33. Furthermore, even in an otherwise healthy woman, pregnancy poses medical risks that are significantly greater than the risks of using contraception. In any given year, the average risk of death from pregnancy is 1 in 11,000 while the risk of death from contraception is much less: 1 in 63,000 for non-smoking oral contraceptive users; 1 in 100,000 for IUD users; and no risk of death for diaphragm users.\\n[*9] 34. Due to the wide variation in effectiveness, cost, and medical appropriateness of available forms of contraception, choice of contraceptive method is essential to successful pregnancy prevention. Other factors that contribute to what type of contraception a woman chooses to use are whether the woman intends to delay, space, or entirely prevent future childbearing.\\n35. Women with medical conditions [**14] that require pregnancy avoidance, in particular, require a full range of contraceptive options because their medical conditions often preclude the use of one or more contraceptive methods. For example, birth control pills are medically contraindicated for smokers over age 35 and women who are at risk of cardiovascular problems, such as stroke, heart attack, blood clots, and hypertension, as well as women who have, or are at risk of, depression or hepatic adenomas.\\n36. For all of the above reasons, a recent study by the Institute of Medicine recommends improving contraceptive coverage in health plans in order to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and to improve health outcomes for women and children. Similarly, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has adopted the goal of improving pregnancy planning and spacing and preventing unintended pregnancy. Moreover, the Guidelines for Women\\'s Health Care published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which represents 38,000 physicians in this country, advises that \"prevention of unwanted pregnancy\" and \"contraceptive options\" be discussed with all women over the age of 13 during routine [**15] primary care assessments. In sum, contraception is basic to women\\'s health and well-being.\\n37. The physical burdens of pregnancy increase the risk of interruption to a woman\\'s education, career and professional development opportunities. The ability to control her biological [*10] potential for pregnancy is central to a woman\\'s ability to participate in the workplace on an equal basis with men.\\n38. Inadequate insurance coverage of contraception has substantial adverse economic consequences for the 67% of American women of reproductive age who rely on employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. These women pay 68% more in out-of-pocket expenditures for health care services than men, and reproductive health services account for much of that difference.\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *10; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **15\\n\\nPage 6\\n\\nV. Statutory Framework\\n39. Title VII provides that: \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to ... discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s ... sex.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(1).\\n40. In 1978, Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\"PDA\") which provides [**16] that the term \"because of sex\" in Title VII includes, but is not limited to, \"because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k). The PDA further states that \"women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\" Id. Thus, Title VII specifically mandates that employers may not single out employees for disadvantageous treatment based on \"pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\"\\n41. Contraception is \"pregnancy-related\" within the meaning of the PDA because it is medical treatment that provides women with the ability to control their biological potential for pregnancy. Exclusion of contraception from a health plan is sex discrimination in violation of the PDA because it treats women differently on the basis of their potential to become pregnant. The [*11] exclusion of contraception from the Health Plan is, therefore, sex discrimination on its face in violation of [**17] Title VII, as amended by the PDA.\\n42. The exclusion of contraception from the Health Plan also has an adverse disparate impact on women in violation of Title VII because it forces them either to pay for prescription contraceptives out of pocket, despite having prescription insurance coverage, or to bear the physical, emotional and financial burdens of unplanned pregnancy. Defendant\\'s policy of excluding contraceptive coverage cannot be justified as job-related and consistent with business necessity.\\nVI. Class Action Allegations\\n43. The proposed class of plaintiffs in this case consists of:\\nAll female employees of AT&T Corp. covered or offered to be covered by health insurance who used prescription contraceptives from August , to the present (hereinafter, Plaintiff Class).\\n44. This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Plaintiff is informed and believes that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. AT&T employs thousands of people across the nation, a large percentage of whom are women, who participate in the AT&T health and drug plans. Given the number of qualifying employees and [**18] the well-documented utilization rates for prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, plaintiff is informed and believes that the class consists of at least 100 persons.\\n45. Commonality is met. Plaintiff class members have common issues of law:\\n(i) whether the failure to provide coverage for female prescription contraceptives a violation of Title VII and/or the PDA by disparate treatment or disparate impact;\\n(ii) whether AT&T violated Title VII and/or PDA;\\n(iii) whether Health Insurer violated Title VII and/or PDA;\\n[*12] (iv) the measure of damages for Plaintiffs who obtain contraceptives anyway; and\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *12; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **18\\n\\nPage 7\\n\\n(v) the measure of damages for Plaintiffs who did not obtain contraceptives.\\nThe common factual issues are:\\n(i) Did Defendants provide and/or offer health insurance that did not provide coverage for prescription contraceptives for women;\\n(ii) did Defendants cause damages to Plaintiff Class as a result;\\n(iii) what amount of damages resulted from the discrimination to the Plaintiff Class;\\n(iv) whether equitable relief, such as an injunction, should be awarded by the Court.\\n46. The claims of the representative party are typical [**19] of the claims of the class. Ms. Stocking was enrolled in AT&T\\'s health and drug plans during the class period. Like every other member of the class, Ms. Stocking has been denied benefits of her employment based on a pregnancy-related medical condition. Furthermore, the AT&T contraception exclusion has had an adverse disparate impact on her, as it has on other female employees of AT&T.\\n47. Plaintiff is an adequate class representative for the Plaintiff Class and Plaintiff\\'s counsel are experienced in prosecuting nationwide class actions and in federal court litigation. Ms. Stocking has exhausted administrative remedies on behalf of herself and the class.\\n48. The common questions of fact or law will predominate over any individual issues as every class member would have the same law applicable to its claims for liability and for damages and the same common questions of fact would have to be presented each time a class member brought suit against Defendants.\\n49. A nationwide class action is superior to any other method to adjudicate the claims of all members of the Plaintiff Class.\\n[*13] 50. This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) [**20] because AT&T has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making compensation, declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief appropriate for the class as a whole.\\nVII. Claims\\nA. Violation of Title VII\\n51. By providing or offering discriminatory health insurance to its employees, AT&T violates Title VII by disparate treatment since the benefit plan for health insurance is discriminatory on its face and by disparate impact because the health insurance excludes coverage for benefits that are uniquely designed for women. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant\\'s violation of Title VII, Plaintiff and other AT&T female employees have suffered damages by paying for prescription contraceptives and are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent further discrimination.\\nB. Violation of Pregnancy Discrimination Act\\n52. In addition to violating Title VII, Defendants have also violated the PDA by disparate treatment and/or disparate impact, causing proximate damages to Plaintiff and entitling her to injunctive relief.\\nVIII. Prayer for Relief\\n53. On behalf of herself and all other persons similarly [**21] situated, Plaintiff Susan Stocking seeks the following relief:\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *13; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **21\\n\\nPage 8\\n\\n(a) That an order be entered certifying the Class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and/or (b)(3).\\n[*14] (b) That a declaratory judgment be entered declaring that AT&T has violated the civil rights of Ms. Stocking and the Class she represents as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.\\n(c) That a permanent injunction be entered prohibiting AT&T from engaging in the illegal and discriminatory conduct alleged herein.\\n(d) That the Court award equitable relief to Ms. Stocking and the Class in the form of damages and incidental monetary relief.\\n(e) That the Court award Ms. Stocking and the Class their attorneys\\' fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k).\\n(f) That the Court award such other and further relief as it deems just and proper under the circumstances.\\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that the Court certify this case as a class action, approve an appropriate class notice, require Defendants to provide the class notice in accordance with their regular distribution of paychecks or health insurance information, and upon the trial [**22] of this case award the Plaintiff Class damages, attorneys\\' fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, equitable relief such as an injunction, and costs.\\nATTORNEYS\\' LIEN CLAIMED.\\nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED.\\n[*15] Respectfully submitted,\\n/s Sylvester \"Sly\" James, Jr. MO # 33617 Michael J.

Holtsclaw, Defeo, Holtsclaw, Kendall, LLC, Sylvester James, Jr., The Sly James Firm, Trial Lawyers PC, Kansas City, MO, for Plaintiff.\\nBrian N. Woolley, Lathrop & Gage, L.C., Kansas City, MO, Laura M. Franze, Marcia Nelson Jackson, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, LLP, Dallas, TX, for Defendant.\\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\\nSACHS, District Judge.\\nAs stated in a prior ruling (Doc. 55) plaintiff Susan Stocking has received an EEOC determination that defendant\\'s health care program she had selected contained a restriction that violated her rights as an employee, under Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 2000e(k). Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in effect until July 1, 2002, there was no coverage for contraceptives prescribed for birth control. Such contraceptives thereafter became available for mail-order acquisition under that program.\\nPlaintiff initially sought damages for her past expenditures for prescribed contraceptives and also an injunction against the new mail-order limitations. Class certification was sought. It was denied without prejudice in the prior ruling because plaintiff was not personally opposed to the mailorder system, and had discontinued her contraceptive use. Plaintiff now limits her complaint to the damage claim (amounting to roughly $1 per day) and renews her request for class certification. Cross-motions for summary judgment on the merits have been filed. Defendant also vigorously contests class certification. The essential facts are not in dispute.\\nOral argument and supplemental briefing have recently occurred. For reasons stated below, I will grant plaintiff Stocking summary judgment on the merits but for a limited damage period as advocated by defendant; that is, 300 days before filing of the charge. I will certify a class, with plaintiff as the class representative, for female employees of defendant with similar health insurance who purchased prescribed contraceptives for birth control during the period from October 31, 2001, through the month of June, 2002. Some qualified claimants, like plaintiff herself, will not be entitled to damages for the entire period.\\nProcedurally it would have been preferable to make a class action determination somewhat earlier. That did not occur because of what I concluded was a false start by plaintiff. Now that the class issues and motions going to the merits are ripe for ruling, I believe I should deal with the merits first, which will help place the request for class certification in clear focus.\\n1016 *1016 I.\\nBefore 2002 AT & T offered plans covering prescribed contraceptives for management employees, but only on a mail-order basis. Certain elective programs, such as an HMO option that was available to non-management personnel like plaintiff, also covered prescribed contraceptives. As stated in my earlier ruling, use of the HMO option would apparently have imposed limitations on health coverage that plaintiff did not want, so she was not interested in submitting to that plan in order to get coverage for prescribed contraceptives. Plaintiff discontinued\\n\\n\\x0cprescribed contraceptives several months after October, 2001, and now relies on a single purchase for $101.07 for a three-month supply. Defendant has calculated her potential recovery, after a co-pay deduction, of only $68.07.\\nBecause of the class action potential, given that defendant AT & T is a large employer, the small claim here has been strenuously litigated by both sides.\\nPrior to July, 2002, the exclusion of prescribed contraceptives apparently was treated as a cost-saving device for what the parties to the collective bargaining agreement considered to be nonessential medical treatment. This disregards the sex-related circumstance that the limitation of prescribed contraceptives applies to women only, under current availability conditions, and also disregards the importance of pregnancy or freedom from that condition for women, for health conditions, narrowly defined, and otherwise.\\nI will not fully rehearse the legal issues because that has been done by several district judges. As least one case is on appeal. I now understand that two unpublished decisions favor defendant employer, but their treatment is rather summary or does not discuss contrary authority, which I now find quite compelling. Alexander v. American Airlines, 2002 WL 731815 (N.D.Tex.); Cummins v. State of Illinois, unreported, Case No.2002-CV-4201-JPG (S.D.Ill., Aug. 30, 2005). Three more fully reasoned and published decisions favor plaintiff on the discrimination claim. Erickson v. Bartell Drug. Co., 141 F.Supp.2d 1266 (W.D.Wash.2001); Cooley v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., 281 F.Supp.2d 979 (E.D.Mo.2003); In re Union Pacific R.R. Employment Practices Litigation, 378 F.Supp.2d 1139 (D.Neb.2005). A sixth decision rejects the Pregnancy Act claim but allows the case to go forward on a Title VII sex discrimination claim. Wright v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., unreported, Case No. 4:03 CV 1873 CDP (E.D.Mo. Jan. 10, 2005).[1]\\nIn my initial reaction to the issues in this case, I noted some skepticism as to the merits because both men and women use contraceptives, just as both men and women may seek treatment for infertility. The same observation appears in Alexander and Cummins. There is controlling appellate authority that the denial to a woman of fertility treatment cannot give rise to a sound claim for discrimination because of sex, either under Title VII or the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Krauel v. Iowa Methodist Medical Center, 95 F.3d 674 (8th Cir.1996). This ruling was distinguished in Cooley and Union Pacific, but has been relied on as a bar to PDA claims regarding prescription contraceptives in Cummins and Wright.\\n1017 *1017 The most thorough consideration of the differences between denying prescription contraceptives to women and men is found in Judge Smith Camp\\'s opinion in Union Pacific. There, in addition to the fact that there are no current prescription contraceptives for men, it was explained that contraception, in preventing paternity, has a major social significance for men but avoidance of pregnancy has both social and physical significance for women. The Circuit in Krauel noted the distinction by stating that \"potential pregnancy, unlike fertility, is a medical condition that is sexrelated because only women can become pregnant.\" 95 F.3d at 680.\\nIt seems worth mentioning that Judge Perry, in Wright, departed from her colleague\\'s ruling in Cooley, based on a rationale going back to Krauel. I am persuaded by Union Pacific, and conclude that we do have a sound Pregnancy Discrimination Act claim here, as well as a soundly alleged Title VII claim (a conclusion consistent with that of Judge Perry in Wright).[2]\\nII.\\nDefendant contends this entire case is time-barred because the denial of prescription contraceptives was contained in a collective bargaining agreement that it made in 1998, long before the charge was filed here in 2002, and plaintiff did not file a charge although she had notice of the particular restriction at least by January, 2000. AT & T seeks to distinguish the contrary ruling on timeliness in a very recent Eighth Circuit case where women firefighters successfully complained of being required to use specialized clothing designed for men and facilities discrimination that had a long history, but continued into the 300-day period before the charge was filed. Wedow v. City of Kansas City, 442 F.3d 661 (8th Cir.2006).\\n\\n\\x0cWedow accepts guidance from National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), which greatly modifies pre-existing law regarding so-called continuing violations. The concept was severely restricted, being now only clearly available in hostile work environment cases. Morgan effectively preserves many claims previously rejected on timeliness grounds, but at the same time greatly restricts the period for which damages are available. See Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), reaffirmed in Morgan and relied on in Wedow.\\nIt is clear, under Wedow, that timely claims can be filed where there are specifically discriminatory working conditions, benefits, wages and the like that may have had a long history but continue into the 300-day period for filing charges. Defendant\\'s principal argument to the contrary in this case is that it took no direct action during the immediate pre-charge period, such as issuing a discriminatory payroll check. But there was no requirement of recent direct action in Wedow. Other situations of discrimination occur that do not require current employer action. Continued inaction suffices in situations like this. One might also suggest that issuance of a discriminatory 1018 paycheck is not the wrong complained of, but rather the failure to *1018 make greater payments. That is essentially what occurred here.\\nPlaintiff bought and paid for prescription contraceptives on at least one occasion for which a timely charge could be filed. She sought no reimbursement from defendant or the insurance company in question. That would clearly have been a futile act, as defendant acknowledges. A claimant is generally not required to engage in a futile act to preserve a right. Failure to exhaust available remedies is not presented as a defense this case. The analogy to Wedow seems unmistakable, and I will deny defendant\\'s motion for summary judgment, except as to the damage period.\\nIII.\\nThe parties in their motions ask for different rulings on the period open to plaintiff (and her class, if certified). Defendant contends that plaintiff is time-barred from claiming expenses of prescription drugs incurred before the 300-day period allowed in Missouri for making charges of discrimination. Thus, she would have no claim for the time after she stopped using contraceptives and no claim for any uncompensated expenditures before October 31, 2001. Plaintiff argues that there was a continuing wrong during the entire period of the collective bargaining agreement.\\nI agree with defendant in its contention that remediable wrongs occurred from time to time when plaintiff made purchases under the discriminatory agreement, but only to the extent such purchases occurred within 300 days of filing the charge.\\nA recent application of the principle involved occurred in Wedow v. City of Kansas City, Mo., supra. In that case a jury found that women firefighters had been forced to use ill-fitting, cumbersome, and somewhat disabling and potentially dangerous clothing of the type suitable for and supplied to male firefighters. Plaintiffs had also been supplied discriminatory rest-room facilities. Although the discriminatory policies long pre-dated the filing of charges, the complainants were confined to damages occurring during the 300-day limitations period. The Court of Appeals found the claims \"akin to the line of cases stemming from Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 395, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986)(holding that each week\\'s paycheck that delivers less on a discriminatory basis is a separate Title VII violation).\" 442 F.3d at 671. This has sometimes been referred to as a \"serial violation.\" The Court also relied on the most recent Supreme Court handling of the issue of \"continuing violations\". National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, supra. In using hostile work environment claims as rare examples of continuing violations the Supreme Court emphasized how rarely the concept could be used to avoid the short limitation period created by Congress. Absent the narrow range of cases that fall within a \"continuing violation\" concept, the Supreme Court emphasized that a \"discrete . . . discriminatory act `occurred\\' on the day that it `happened\\'. A party, therefore, must file a charge within either 180 or 300 days of the date of the act or lose the ability to recover for it.\" 536 U.S. at 110, 122 S.Ct. 2061. (emphasis added). In rejecting further frequent use of the \"continuing violation\" theory, the Court referred to the EEOC\\'s advocacy of the concept of \"certain serial violations and systemic violations\" that would allow a longer period of recovery. The Court stated that such\\n\\n\\x0cinterpretive guidelines must yield to the Supreme Court\\'s role as a final authority. 536 U.S. at 110-1, n. 6, 122 S.Ct. 2061. Advocacy by plaintiff of these concepts after the Morgan decision is thus unsound.\\n1019 Plaintiff now acknowledges (Doc. 122) that Morgan eliminated the possibility *1019 of using serial violations to avoid the 300 day limitation on recoveries. She claims however, that \"systemic violations\" can still be used. In the previously quoted footnote, the Morgan opinion put both categories in the same basket. Moreover, the violation here, as in Wedow, was clearly of a serial nature, dependent on repeated purchases, even though \"systemic\" in the sense that employer policies of general application originated the discriminatory conduct. Where, as here, the violation of rights can be broken down into a series of discrete acts, a common source, through company-wide or \"systemic policy\", does not preserve old claims. See Davidson v. America Online, Inc., 337 F.3d 1179, 1184-6 (10th Cir.2003).\\nPlaintiff contends the continuing violation theory is still usable in post-Morgan cases involving discriminatory salary contentions and cites Tademe v. Saint Cloud State University, 328 F.3d 982, 989 (8th Cir.2003). That case uses Bazemore language, however, and notes that the claim of discrimination was timely because the charge was filed within 300 days of the last discriminatory pay-checks. There was no occasion to rule or comment on the question of a 300-day cutoff for damages because the Circuit sustained summary judgment for defendant on the merits. Thus Tademe cannot be cited as contrary to the result in Wedow.[3]\\nBeing unable to cite cases decided after Morgan in support of a contention that recovery can be had for events earlier than the 300 days allowed for filing charges, plaintiff falls back on a different statute of limitations than the one governing the filing of charges. Civil actions by a person aggrieved by employment discrimination may be filed under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f), which contains no periodic cutoff language for remedies. Another subsection relating to injunctions and equitable relief does contain the following: \"Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission\". 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1). Plaintiff contends the statutory language in itself frees her from the restrictions advocated by defendant.\\nAs stated by the First Circuit some years before Morgan, \"By allowing for the possibility of recovering back pay for over a year prior to the 300 day filing period, `Congress must have envisioned continuing remediable violations that existed prior to the running of the period.\\'\" Sabree v. United Bhd. Of Carpenters and Joiners, 921 F.2d 396, 401 (1st Cir.1990). Even more compelling, as a pre-Morgan citation, is an opinion by Judge Loken for our Circuit. Ashley v. Boyle\\'s Famous Corned Beef Co., 66 F.3d 164 (8th Cir. en banc 1995). In that case, on allegations that gender discrimination tainted the plaintiff\\'s rate of pay, the Court ruled that \"relief back to the beginning of the limitations period strikes a reasonable balance between permitting redress of an ongoing wrong and imposing liability for conduct long past\" 66 F.3d at 168. A charge was filed in November, 1992 concerning a continuing pay discrimination practice dating back to 1986. It is my understanding of the opinion that it would allow back pay recovery to November, 1990.\\n1020 If there is conflicting language in Title VII, it seems clear that Morgan resolves *1020 the conflict in favor of the shortened recovery period, despite the oddity in drafting that affects remedial relief in injunction cases. While the parties and I do not find substantial appellate court discussion of the issue, the plain language of Justice Thomas in Morgan effectively \"eviscerates the continuing violation doctrine outside of hostile environment claims\", as contended by the successful defendant in Lewis v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 271 F.Supp.2d 807, 813 (E.D.Va.2003). If the Ashley \"reasonable balance\" is to be reinstated it will require legislation.\\nTherefore partial summary judgment will be entered in favor of defendant, limiting plaintiff\\'s remedy to uncompensated expenditures for prescription contraceptives subsequent to October 31, 2001.\\nIV.\\nHaving given up her earlier claim for injunctive relief, plaintiff now seek designation of a class of female employees of defendant seeking damages under Rule 23(b)(3), F.R.Civ.Proc. She needs a finding that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudication of the controversy. As in all class actions there must be satisfaction of the elements of Rule 23(a), which include numerosity making\\n\\n\\x0cjoinder impracticable, questions of law or fact in common, typicality of the claims of the plaintiff as proposed representative, and assurance to the court that plaintiff as a representative would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\\nPlaintiff\\'s deposition has been taken, with excerpts supplied to the court by counsel. During the course of litigation I have become somewhat familiar with the performance of counsel in this variety of litigation. Defendant basically questions the thoroughness of the record on the class action elements and seeks denial of a class action because members of the class would have so many individualized histories that it would allegedly be very burdensome to develop damage claims with any precision or uniformity.\\nStarting with plaintiff, her motivation is asserted to be the establishment of the rights of women employees of AT & T to nondiscrimination in health care benefits. While arguably much of this interest has become satisfied, as of July, 2002, I am not charged with appraising a claim of overzealous prosecution of litigation which might currently be categorized as an effort to obtain rather nominal damages for a previous violation of rights. The main thing for me to guard against is personal venality or an effort to use the class for personal benefit. That is not inferable and is not claimed by defendant.\\nCounsel are deemed to be skillful and experienced enough to serve as class counsel, and that is also not a subject of challenge by defendant.\\nIn light of the small damage claim available to each member of the class, it is realistically certain that only a class action could feasibly result in an adjudication of the rights here at stake. The superiority of a class action proceeding is the dominant factor in my determination.\\nDefendant challenges the showing of numerosity, but I can almost take judicial notice that this is not a serious issue. The basic question to be decided is whether I should require joinder rather than create a class, and that would only be a close question if we were dealing with several dozen or fewer prospective members of that class. That is the significance of numerosity. A distinction needs to be made between prospective class members and 1021 likely class members. I cannot predict with any confidence that more than several dozen *1021 individuals would choose to remain in the class, given the small stakes and the nuisance involved in reconstructing or remembering medical history enough to specify it under oath. But the question is whether an unmanageable number of persons are prospective members of the class. Compare Cox v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir.1986).\\nWith a very large company like AT & T I must assume a very considerable number of women of child-bearing age would be in non-management positions and would be using birth control, either by relying on a male partner or by themselves. The need for prescription contraceptives for many women would be a matter I can accept as a matter of judicial notice. Even if a large number of employees elected HMOs, where prescription contraceptives were available, it is fair to assume there are a significant number of individuals similarly situated with plaintiff. If the number throughout the country is at least 100-500 that would, in my judgment, be vastly more than would satisfy the numerosity requirement and it seems almost frivolous to question that such figures exist. While the burden is on plaintiff, defendant could doubtless make a good estimate and perhaps has done so. The question is less technical, and more susceptible to ruling as a matter of common knowledge, than the numerical issue in Yong Soon Oh v. AT & T Corp. 224 F.R.D. 357 (D.N.J.2004).\\nFor present purposes I accept numerosity. Common questions exist, and will define the class that would be created. Plaintiffs claims are clearly typical, except for her discontinuance of contraceptives mid-point in the 300 day period. This would create a problem of fairness in using this representative if the members of the class were thereby denied the right to claim damages through the month of June, 2002. Defendant suggests no authorities that would terminate the rights of members simply because plaintiff changed her practice. Members of the class, for better or worse, use their own experiences to establish damages. Members of the class, although personally dilatory in pursuing their $1 a day entitlement, are of course able to use plaintiffs charge to get them into court. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). Although that may have given defendant the idea that claimants would be dependent on plaintiffs rights to damages I am satisfied this concept relates only to filing procedure. Because Albemarle allows class members to benefit from plaintiffs standing, plaintiff contends they should not be limited by residing in a state with a 180-day filing requirement.\\n\\n\\x0cThe weight of authority, however, seems to limit damages for class members living in non-deferral States to injury incurred during the 180 day period prior to filing of a charge on which those claimants can rely. See, e.g., Church v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc., 137 F.R.D. 294, 309-10 (N.D.Cal.1991) Although I am thus presently inclined to accept defendant\\'s contention as to the controlling time periods, that does not affect class certification or class description. The class description should be inclusive, in my judgment, for the sake of simplicity, with damage limitations for individual claimants to be determined later (if the parties consider that worth the trouble). Just as claimants who, like plaintiff, may have discontinued use of prescription contraceptives during the time-frame established by the charge, and may thus be restricted to a limitation on recoveries, those claimants living in the handful of non-deferral States would simply have a damage limitation imposed. In any event, defendant\\'s contention about non-deferral States would not affect class certification but would at most, favor use of a subclass.\\n1022 *1022 None of the issues mentioned in Rule 23(b)(3) or 23(a) create problems for creation of a class other than the one defendant emphasizes; that is, the many different histories that individuals in the class are likely to present. Even that issue is, in my judgment, nearly frivolous, in light of the very small sum of money anyone can claim, and the practical strictures that both sides will feel in pursuing and debating such differences. I cannot imagine defendant spending half a day of time in specific discovery or in challenging some individual claim. This might result in some vulnerability to false claims, which is also not an issue before me, but would probably be dealt with through sworn documents relating to claims.[4] The experience in the Union Pacific case, as evidenced in the opinions, confirms my view that the parties, in the interest of practicality, could probably agree on a settlement alternative for individuals that would likely dispose of the bulk of claims. Administrative proceedings have been devised in the railroad case that could simplify things here. Defendant does not adequately respond to that experience, except to say that it was initiated \"under a completely different class action standard.\" This has no bearing on the processing of damage claims. In other words, management of the class action should not predictably be very burden-some-unless one simply resents the expense of litigation.\\nA class will therefore be certified, with Susan Stocking as representative of the class.\\nIt is therefore ORDERED that plaintiff\\'s motion for summary judgment as to liability is GRANTED, defendant\\'s motion for summary judgment is DENIED, except that it is GRANTED in limiting damages to the period from October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002, and plaintiff\\'s renewed motion for class certification is GRANTED.\\nThe parties are directed to negotiate a plan for further proceedings pursuant to these rulings and to propose an agreed order or series of specific orders within thirty days of this date.[5] If unable to agree plaintiff shall file her proposed order(s) on that day and defendant shall file objections and counter proposals within seven days there after. SO ORDERED.\\n[1] Years ago it was customary to disregard or devalue unpublished trial court decisions because almost anything can be out there, and there is suspicion that counsel will skew their disclosures to favor their clients-although suppression of adverse authority would be unethical. Published decisions continue to have more weight, in general, because they reflect the significance attached to them by the author.\\n[2] I acknowledge that conceptually the Title VII claims seems more obviously appropriate than the PDA claim, because the avoidance of pregnancy was somewhat outside the target area of the PDA. Union Pacific makes a persuasive showing, however, that the language of the Pregnancy Act can fairly be read to reach the current subject. The sufficiency of Title VII without the PDA amendment is accepted in Wright, but the problem there is with earlier Supreme Court cases. Unless and until the Circuit speaks differently, I accept Union Pacific on the PDA and Wright on Title VII. We likely will have an appellate ruling before this case is in final judgment.\\n[3] See another post-Morgan case where a claimant abandoned at oral argument her contention that she could recover in a discriminatory compensation case for a period outside the 300-day charge filing period. Hildebrandt v. Illinois Dept. of Natural Resources, 347 F.3d 1014, 1025 (7th Cir.2003). Taking another tack, plaintiff seeks to distinguish \"wage discrimination cases\" from this one. Reply Brief, Doc. 109, page 13, note 18. Such cases are, however, closer to this case than a hostile work environment case would be. Wedow is an example.\\n\\n\\x0c[4] A questionnaire can be worked out that would deal with all issues that might eliminate claims-such as contraceptive users for medical necessity (which was always covered by the program) rather than simply birth control.

(Doc. 108). The documents at issue are billing and refund records which the hospital contends reveal confidential medical information of non-party patients. The hospital is willing to produce the records provided the records are subject to a protective order meeting the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (see 45 C.F.R. § 164.512).1 (Doc. 121).\\n\\n1\\n\\nHIPAA protects “protected health information” from\\n\\ndisclosure. “Protected health information” means\\n\\nindividually identifiable health information that is\\n\\nmaintained and/or transmitted in any form or medium.\\n\\n45 C.F.R. § 160.103.\\n\\nThe protective order proposed by the hospital and rejected by plaintiff would redact virtually all identifying information, including addresses, all elements of dates except the year (including birth, admission and discharge dates), phone numbers, e-mail addresses, Social Security\\n\\nnumbers, account numbers, medical record numbers and health plan beneficiary numbers. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 5). The parties themselves are free to characterize documents as “confidential” or “confidential-counsel only.” (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 3). “Confidential-counsel only” documents are not to be shown to plaintiff Anthony Camillo, although his counsel is permitted to view the materials. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 6(b)). If such documents are to be shown to consulting experts, an executed non-disclosure form identifying the expert must be presented to the hospital in advance. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 8).\\nPlaintiff contends that the aforementioned redactions would prevent cross-referencing other documents. Plaintiff notes that the parties agree that the documents will be used only for purposes of this litigation. Plaintiff also feels hamstrung by the “confidential- *522 counsel only” designation, which would preclude the relator himself, who is familiar with Medicare billing practices, from participating in this litigation. Plaintiff further objects to having to reveal experts whose identities may not be required to be revealed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\\nThe hospital counters that Illinois law is stricter than HIPAA privacy provisions with respect to non-party patient information and do not permit disclosure of records in this situation, and that comity should compel adherence to the Illinois law. See 735 ILCS § 5/8-802 and 45 C.F.R. § 160.203(b). The redaction provisions are aimed at satisfying the Illinois law, not HIPAA. With respect to plaintiff’s need to cross-reference documents, the hospital contends that the issue in this case is alleged double-billing to medicare and nursing homes, which has nothing to do with individual patient accounts, so patient privacy should prevail. The hospital asserts that plaintiff/relator Camillo has a history of falsifying forms and forging signatures, which indicates great potential for misuse of protected information. Lastly, the hospital reasserts its initial objection to the relevance and scope of plaintiff’s request for production No. 18, regarding billing information.\\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) permits the discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter of the pending action, so long as the sought after information is not privileged, even if inadmissible at trial, if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Supreme Court has interpreted relevance broadly to include any matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter that could bear on, any issue that is or may be in the case. Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351, 98 S.Ct. 2380, 57 L.Ed.2d 253 (1978). Discovery may be had from any person, provided that the person from whom discovery is sought is not subjected to\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cU.S. ex rel. Camillo v. Ancilla Systems, Inc., 233 F.R.D. 520 (2005)\\n\\nannoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c), 30(b), 34, and 45. Accordingly, in a situation such as this, the interests of the plaintiff and the non-party patients must be balanced.\\n[1] The Fifth Amended Complaint alleges that the defendant hospital and its parent company violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq., by bundling chemical profile tests when billing nursing homes and unbundling those charges when billing Medicare, double billing in various manners, and submitting multiple and excessive bills. (Doc. 122). Although the hospital correctly observes that this action is not about individual patients, plaintiff obviously needs to be able to compare and cross-reference documents in order to pinpoint which bills and refunds support the alleged fraudulent activity. Because names, account numbers, etc., can be manipulated to conceal improper activities, plaintiff needs to be able to cross-reference multiple identifiers to identify which bills and refunds are properly the subject of this action. Therefore, the Court finds plaintiff’s requests for production Nos. 18 and 19 relevant\\n[2] [3] HIPAA permits protected health information to be revealed in response to a discovery request, if the parties agree to a protective order and have presented it to the Court, or have asked the Court for a protective order. 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(e)(1). The protective order should prohibit the use or disclosure of the protected health information for any purpose other than the litigation, and require the return or destruction of the protected health information (including all copies made) at the end of the litigation or proceeding. Id. The HIPAA provisions do not create a privilege against production or admission of evidence; they merely create a procedure for obtaining protected medical record in litigation. Northwestern Memorial Hospital v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 923, 925-926 (7th Cir.2004); see also Fed.R.Evid. 501. By all accounts, the parties agree to abide by the HIPAA requirements. However, the defendant hospital wants plaintiff to also comply with the more stringent requirements of Illinois law, which would not permit the disclosure of identifying information in this situation. See 735 ILCS 5/8-802.\\nThe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in Northwestern Memorial Hospital v. Ashcroft that a more restrictive state law cannot be used in a federal-question *523 action such as this to hamstring the enforcement of federal law. 362 F.3d at 925. Because Illinois law would, at a minimum, redact the identifying information needed to analyze the hospital’s billing practices, any interest in comity must fall by the wayside. Accordingly, paragraph 5 of the protective order proposed by the hospital is unacceptable. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 5).\\n[4] Turning to the “confidential-counsel only” provision of the protective order proposed by the hospital (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 6(b)), the Court first takes issue with the fact\\n\\nthat the hospital is given free rein to, in effect, characterize information as privileged or afforded additional protections. The determination of good cause cannot be left to the parties, that is the Court’s prerogative. Fed.R.Civ.P.26(c). Furthermore, the hospital has failed to show cause for restricting the plaintiff/relator’s access to the billing and refund documentation. Any fears of spoliation of evidence should be allayed by the very fact that the hospital remains in possession of the original records. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the plaintiff/relator will abuse the HIPAA-protected documents. Therefore, paragraph 6(b) of the protective order proposed by the hospital is entirely unacceptable. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 6(b)).\\n[5] The Court agrees that it is appropriate to have those permitted access to HIPAA-protected documents execute a non-disclosure form. However, the hospital has failed to show sufficient cause for requiring advance authorization from the hospital, especially insofar as plaintiff would be forced to reveal experts or consultants plaintiff would otherwise not be required to reveal. There is no reason not to trust plaintiff’s counsel to ensure that non-disclosure forms are executed and logged, and confidentiality maintained. Therefore, paragraph 8 of the protective order proposed by the hospital is unacceptable in the aforementioned respects. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 8).\\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, for the aforestated reasons, plaintiff Camillo’s motion to compel defendant Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital to produce documents in response to plaintiff’s requests for production Nos. 18 and 19, propounded on or about February 3, 2005, (Doc. 108) is GRANTED.\\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, on or before November 18, 2005, the parties shall execute a HIPAA qualified protective order in compliance with the rulings contained within this order; a motion for entry of said protective order shall be immediately filed and the executed protective order submitted to the Court at <cippd@ilsd.uscourts.gov> for final review and approval.\\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital shall have seven calendar days from the date the Court files the approved protective order to produce the requested HIPAA-protected documents to plaintiff.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\nParallel Citations\\nMed & Med GD (CCH) P 301,767\\n\\t\\r \\xa0\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cU.S. ex rel.

SACHS, United States District Judge.\\n*1 This case concerns alleged sex discrimination in the employer’s denial of health care costs for prescription contraceptives (prior to a change in the program in 2002). It now comes back to me for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals has rejected the challenge to a similar program. In re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (2007). In partial reliance on the district court’s ruling in Union Pacific, I granted summary judgment to the plaintiff here and created a class for determination of compensation. Stocking v. AT & T Corporation, 436 F.Supp.2d 1014 (W.D.Mo.2006).\\nDefendant now moves for reconsideration. Doc. 151. Opposition has been filed (Doc. 153) and a reply has been received. Doc. 154. Both sides seek oral argument. Having concluded that defendant is clearly entitled to prevail, based on the appellate decision, it is not necessary to explore multiple issues posed by the parties or to hear argument.\\nPlaintiff now limits her contention to an issue of disparate\\n\\nimpact, not expressly discussed by the Court of Appeals. Because I conclude that was no discrimination, under the majority ruling above, the case falls in any event. Definition of the main issue seems controlling. If treated as a discrimination claim in compensating for prescription contraceptives, a form of health care exclusively used by women, plaintiff and her class would seem to have a sound case. If treated as a blanket denial of funding for all contraceptives, whether used by men or women, the discrimination case fails. The policy was facially neutral and neutral in fact. No one was repaid for such expenses. The majority of the panel characterized the question in the latter manner (479 F.3d at 943-5), and I necessarily adopt that view on remand. See also Krauel litigation discussion in the Reply Brief, pp 4-5, Doc. 154.1\\n\\n1\\n\\nI am not prepared to reopen litigation for some sort of\\n\\nstudy of male and female contraception expenses.\\n\\nI agree with the pertinent portions of defendant’s argument presented in Doc. 151.\\nIt may be useful to mention some reservations about portions of defendant’s briefing that may be a form of overkill. Defendant argues that, in any event, the claim made is out of time, under the current ruling by the Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 127 S.Ct. 2162 (2007). That case may not be pertinent to a disparate impact theory because turning on a conclusion that there was no showing or inference of discriminatory animus in the application of an earlier program to the plaintiff during the limited period before discrimination charges were filed. Since an impact case does not require discriminatory animus one doubts that Ledbetter can be invoked.\\nQuoting from an opinion by Judge (now Justice) Kennedy, defendant contends that disparate impact cases are confined to the “job selection process” and not to other issues such as benefits. AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir.1985). In several other Circuits, but not the Eighth, this narrowing of impact relief has been cited. Judge Posner has observed that the denial of relief in comparable worth cases conflicts with the theory that disparate impact can be pursued in a logical manner to impose statutory liability. See, e.g. Davidson v. Board of Governors, 920 F.2d 441, 445-6 (7th Cir.1990). Because of inconsistency in theories, it would seem (without further sorting out of cases) that disparate impact might be confined to the “job selection process” or that the comparable worth cases could be confined to that issue-or some intermediate line-drawing could occur. I need not deal with that here.2\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cStocking v.

            "long summary: On January 23, 2004, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 2000e(k), against AT&T Corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, was a former AT&T employee and asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that AT&T's health insurance policy discriminated against women.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendant's health insurance plan, which did not provide prescription contraceptives (birth control) before 2002 and only through the mail after 2002, violated female employees' civil rights.\n",
            "\n",
            "The action originally started in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, but was transferred to Missouri on May 12, 2003.  This is the date on which the docket begins.  Originally, there were two plaintiffs on the case, but one dropped out of the litigation.  Thus, a single plaintiff carried forth the case.\n",
            "\n",
            "On September 3, 2004, the Court (Judge Sachs) denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification.  In the opinion, the Court barely discussed the requirements for a class-action lawsuit, except to point out typicality.  The plaintiff, since the suit began, had stopped taking birth control and was seeking to get pregnant.  Therefore, the Court declared that a class could not be certified without a class representative who would have an ongoing interest in the prayed-for relief.  The plaintiff wanted to recover her past expenditures on the prescribed contraceptives.  The Women's Law project came onto the case as an amicus.  After a lengthy discovery period, the Court made another ruling.\n",
            "\n",
            "On June 7, 2006, the Court (Judge Sachs) granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification as to the damages in the complaint.  The class was comprised of female employees of AT&T, who paid for their own prescription contraception from the dates of October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002.  The Court did not certify the claims for injunctive or declaratory relief because as of 2002, the health insurance provider covered birth control through mail order. While the cost of the plaintiff's potential recovery was relatively small, $68.07, the class action potential in the litigation, given AT&T's size made both parties fight vigorously.  According to the docket, neither side was content with this decision.  The plaintiff wanted the period of time for damages claims to be extended, and the defendant did not approve of the decision at all.  Ultimately, the plaintiffs filed an appeal.  \n",
            "\n",
            "On June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a preliminary judgment to the District Court (Judge Sachs).  The Circuit Court advised the District Court to review the findings of another recent case, In Re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2007).  This case featured a ruling that was fundamentally at odds with the decision of the District Court on June 7, 2006.\n",
            "\n",
            "On October 22, 2007, the District Court (Judge Sachs) vacated its previous decision, and ordered a decision in favor of the defendant.  The case was closed the next day on October 23, 2007.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "short summary: This case was brought in 2004 by a female former AT&T employee against AT&T Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiff alleged that AT&T, specifically the company's health insurance policy, discriminated against women, and she sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages.  The Court originally denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification, but later reversed its denial and granted summary judgment to plaintiff, certifying a class to determine compensation.  However, the Court of Appeals referred the District Court Judge to a relevant case which rejected a challenge to a similar program, thereby forcing the Court to vacate its prior ruling and issue judgment in favor of defendants on October 22, 2007.\n",

The plaintiffs were elderly and/or disabled recipients of Medicaid who received daily twenty-four-hour split-shift in-home care through the New York State Medicaid program. The suit was filed against the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health and the Executive Deputy Commissioner of the New York State of Temporary and Disability Assistance (the \\\"State Defendants\\\"), and against the Administrator of the New York City Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services (the \\\"City Defendant\\\"). Plaintiffs brought the action under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1396 et seq. and its implementing regulations; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\\\"ADA\\\"), 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12131 et seq. and its implementing regulations; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\\\"Section 504\\\"), 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 794; and the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment and Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief.\\n\\nThe City Defendant had notified members of the putative class that their home care service hours would be reduced, even though their current level of care was physician-prescribed and there had been no changes to their medical conditions or treatment needs, on the basis that the plaintiffs did not meet the \\\"total assistance\\\" requirement of Medicaid regulations. Plaintiffs argued that this policy was arbitrary and irrational, and that because there was not change in the plaintiffs' conditions, these reductions violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. Plaintiffs argued that the defendants had discriminated against plaintiffs on the basis of disability and that they had put the plaintiffs at risk of unnecessary institutionalization, contrary to the integration and anti-discrimination and mandates of the ADA and Section 504. Plaintiffs also alleged the defendants had violated the Medicaid Act by denying Medicaid recipients a level of equal in amount, scope, and duration to that provided to other Medicaid recipients with the same medical needs.\\n\\nOn June 12, 2012, the parties agreed to a joint stipulation in lieu of temporary restraining order proceedings before the court, wherein the defendants agreed not to reduce the hours of any additional patients, with very limited exceptions, while the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction was pending before the Court.\\n\\nOn June 28, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that removed references to preliminary relief. On August 29, 2012, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims against the Executive Deputy Commissioner. The Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health remained in the case.\\n\\nOn September 4, 2012, the Court (Judge Shira A. Scheindlin) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in part, preventing the defendants from reducing any patients care while the case was pending or until further decisions, except in cases where there were changes to a patient's condition that made the service reduction medically appropriate, as certified by a physician who had personally examined the patient. The Court declined to reinstate twenty-four-hour split-shift care for all those patients whose level of care had been reduced between October 4, 2011 and the date of the injunction. Strouchler v. Shah, 891 F. Supp. 2d 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). The Court denied the Defendants' motion to modify this preliminary injunction on September 12, 2012. \\n\\nOn October 5, 2012, the Court (Judge  Scheindlin) granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, with the Court amending the definition as: \\\"[a]ll New York City Medicaid recipients of continuous personal care services who, at any time since January 1, 2011, have been threatened with unlawful reduction or discontinuance of these services or whose care has been unlawfully reduced or discontinued because the City Defendant has determined that they do not meet the medical criteria for these services.\\\" The Court explained that, because the preliminary injunction was in place, it was unnecessary to include the words \\\"or will be.\\\" Strouchler v. Shah, 286 F.R.D. 244 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).\\n\\nOn October 15, 2012, the parties filed a joint stipulation, with the defendants' agreeing to reinstate the split-shift care of an individual member of the purported class whose service had been reduced to sleep-in care prior to the date of the preliminary injunction. On November 12, 2012, in the wake of the Hurricane Sandy disaster, the Court ordered the defendants to restore split-shift care to 16 individuals identified by the plaintiffs. This order was modified by an order dated November 16, 2012, which referred to a state-level directive ordering the restoration of split-shift care to certain individuals already being served by a \\\"managed long-term care provider.\\\"\\n\\nThe parties then proceeded to the discovery phase of the litigation, while engaging in settlement negotiations. \\n\\nTwo years later, on May 27, 2014, the parties filed a settlement agreement, which was approved by Judge Scheindlin on September 12 of the same year. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the State and City Defendants agreed that continuous personal care services of any Medicaid recipient thereof shall not be reduced or terminated for any of five reasons: \\\"the recipient needs only 'some' assistance;\\\" \\\"the recipient's needs can be predicted or scheduled;\\\" \\\"the recipient's only medical needs are turning and positioning;\\\" \\\"there has been a change in the recipient's medical condition, unless [the State or City] Defendant submits to the recipient a notice that identifies the change and states why the prior services are no longer needed;\\\" or \\\"there has been a mistake in the previous assessment, unless the [local district or City Defendant] submits to the recipient a notice that identifies the mistake and states why the prior services are not needed.\\\" The agreement further stipulates that the State Defendant is to make best efforts to amend state law such that it is consistent with the agreement under the New York State Administrative Procedure Act. In exchange, the plaintiffs released the City and State Defendants from all claims. The case was closed on September 16, 2014.\\n\",\n          \"On October 6, 2015, Prison Legal News (PLN) filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (Knoxville) against the Knox County Sheriff\\u2019s Office. PLN sued under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983, alleging that the defendant violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech, due process, and equal protection by unlawfully censoring the books, magazines, and other mail they sent to inmates at the Knox County Jail. PLN claimed that from November 2014 to October 6, 2015, the defendant refused to deliver all publications and enveloped mail sent by PLN to prisoners at Knox County Jail, which censored PLN\\u2019s correspondence with inmates at the jail on matters of public concern. PLN also claimed that the defendant  failed to inform them of the alleged violation of the jail's mail policy and depriving them of the opportunity to contest the decision. Represented by private counsel, PLN asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. \\n\\nOn October 6, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. \\n\\nOn February 3, 2016, Judge Thomas A Varlan granted the plaintiff\\u2019s motion to stay the action until March 31, 2016, which suspended court proceedings so that the parties could engage in mediation. All other pending motions, including the plaintiff's Oct. 6 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, were denied with leave to refile upon lifting the stay. Mediation efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the plaintiff did not refile their motion.\\n\\nOn October 13, 2016, the defendants filed an amended answer in which they admitted liability on the plaintiff\\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment claims, stating that the jail had revised their inmate mail policy to remove the restrictions that formed the basis for PLN\\u2019s constitutional challenges.\\n\\nOn June 26, 2017, the parties filed a joint stipulation agreeing that: 1) PLN\\u2019s claims against the defendants should be dismissed, and 2) PLN sustained $25,000 in compensatory damages as a result of the defendant\\u2019s unconstitutional practices and should be awarded that amount. They also agreed that these two stipulations resolved all issues in the case except for the plaintiff\\u2019s entitlement to injunctive relief, attorney\\u2019s fees, and costs. \\n\\nThe plaintiff moved for a permanent injunction to prevent the defendant from resuming their unconstitutional practices in the future. The defendant argued that their voluntary cessation of unconstitutional conduct was genuine and that returning to their old practices would be an irrational waste of county resources, given the cost of litigation. The court ruled in favor of the defendant, holding that the issue of injunctive relief was moot because the defendant carried its burden of showing it would not readopt its unconstitutional mail policy in the future. \\n\\nThe court noted that its denial of the plaintiff\\u2019s motion for permanent injunction did not close the case because the parties had yet to file motions concerning the plaintiff\\u2019s entitlement to attorney\\u2019s fees, the only remaining issue of the case. \\n\\nThe parties settled as to attorneys fees on April 4, 2018. The amount they settle for is private. The case is now closed. \",\n          \"On December 9, 2013, a United States citizen of Latino national origin filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The plaintiff, represented by the Legal Aid Society Employment Law Center, brought this complaint under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983, and state law against the state of California. He sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, claiming employment discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clauses and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution and California State Constiuttion, national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and National Origin and Ancestry Discrimination in Violation of\\nCalifornia Fair Employment and Housing Act. The case was assigned to Judge William Alsup.\\n\\nSpecifically, the plaintiff had applied for a job as a Correctional Officer with the California Department of Corrections in 2011.  He claimed that he was unlawfully removed from consideration because he reported in a background questionnaire that prior to becoming a permanent resident and then citizen of the United States, he used a social security number that was not his own to obtain work. Plaintiff paid all required taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) until he obtained his own social security number. He was reportedly removed from consideration because his use of a fake social security number was deemed to \\\"show a lack of honesty, integrity and good judgment.\\\" A similar series of events occurred when plaintiff reapplied for the same position in 2013. \\n\\nThe state responded that questions about the use of a false social security number were necessary to conduct a thorough background investigation of candidates.  The state also asserted that there was no Title VII violation because the plaintiff's claim rested on immigration status and not national origin, and because the hiring statistics indicated that there was no discriminatory effect on Latino hiring at the California Department of Corrections.  \\n\\nOn May 7, 2014, the District Court (Judge William Alsup) dismissed plaintiff's Section 1983 equal protection and substantive due process claims, as well as the Title VII claim against the State Personnel Board, but denied motions to dismiss the Title VII claim against the California Department of Corrections and procedural due process claim. The District Court dismissed all state law claims without prejudice. 2014 WL 1867067.\\n\\nOn July 17, 2015, the District Court denied without prejudice the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend, and directed plaintiff to engage in further discovery prior to his final opportunity to move to amend his equal protection claims and Title VII claim against the State Personnel Board. The court granted him leave on October 29, 2014. 2014 WL 5474950. The plaintiff filed his third and final amend complaint the same day.\\n\\nOn March 12, 2015, the state filed another motion for summary judgment. On July 21, the court granted the plaintiff\\u2019s Title VII claims, holding that asking applicants whether they had ever used a fake social security number had a disparate impact on Latinos. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' equal protection claim. 119 F.Supp.3d 1065. The court issued a final order as to relief on September 28, 2015. This order held that the plaintiff should be allowed to finish the hiring process. If he was able to successfully pass background investigation and complete the training academy, he would be awarded $140,362 in backpay. The plaintiff was also granted attorneys\\u2019 fees. 2015 WL 5681029.\\n\\nOn October 6, 2015, the state appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\\n\\nOn October 30, 2015, the plaintiff moved for the award of his attorneys\\u2019 fees. The parties disagreed about how much in attorneys\\u2019 fees would be appropriate, so the court decided that a third party should decide the amount. 2015 WL 7423229. On January 28, 2016, the court appointed a special master to make this determination. The special master decided that the state owed the plaintiff $1,237,024.82 in fees and costs, and the court approved this amount on June 16, 2016. 2016 WL 3360638.\\n\\nFour days later, the state appealed the order granting attorneys\\u2019 fees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. (Its first appeal had not yet been ruled on.) On May 16, 2017, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\\u2019s judgment as to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation but reversed the judgment as to the State Personnel Board because the Personnel Board was not part of the hiring process and had no say in the questions on the job application. 701 Fed.Appx. 613. The case was remanded to the District Court to reassess damages against one state defendant rather than two. 2017 WL 6270383.\\n\\nOn January 30, the parties filed a stipulation in the Ninth Circuit stating that they resolved the attorneys\\u2019 fees dispute informally, outside of court. In light of this stipulation, the Ninth Circuit dismissed all pending motions as moot on March 27, 2018.\\n\\nThere are no further entries in the docket since March 2018. The case is presumably closed.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary/short\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1129,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This class-action lawsuit was filed on April 23, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

On September 4, 2012, the Court granted in part the Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the Defendants from reducing patients from split-shift care to a lower level of care while the case was pending, with some exceptions.

The plaintiffs, represented by the National ACLU and ACLU of Michigan, asked the court for a declaratory judgment, damages, and injunctive relief concerning the use of \"No Trespass Letters.\" The plaintiffs claimed that the City of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and police officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights. \n",

The plaintiffs alleged they were arrested for trespassing while sitting in their vehicles in a business's parking lot, without any warning or complaint from the business itself. The plaintiffs claimed their arrests were without probable cause and therefore in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance violated the void-for-vagueness doctrine of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n",

            "\n",
            "On December 3, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek declaratory or injunctive relief because they were not suffering an imminent threat of repeated future misconduct. Additionally, defendants argued that the plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were not ripe because the City had changed the No Trespass Letters following the plaintiffs' filling of the Complaint. Defendants did not challenge the Court's jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claim for damages. \n",
            "\n",

            "While the motion to dismiss was still pending, the defendants and the plaintiffs both filed motions for summary judgment. In April 2015, the court postponed the trial date pending the resolution of multiple motions made by both the defendants and the plaintiffs. \n",

The Court held that, because the plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to present a threat of an imminent, as opposed to a speculative, injury, they lacked standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The Court also noted that the City's changes to the No Trespass Letters following the filing of this case rendered the requests for prospective relief unripe.

However, the Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the City's trespass ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. \n",

A damages amount was not publicly disclosed; the ACLU <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/hightower-v-city-grand-rapids\">described</a> it as a \"favorable settlement agreement resulting in significant compensation for each of our four plaintiffs.\" The parties continued litigating over attorney fees, but came to a private agreement on the matter on December 23, 2019.

        "text='''On May 1, 2013, two men who were arrested for trespassing on property open to the public filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the City of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and two individual officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the National ACLU and ACLU of Michigan, asked the court for a declaratory judgment, damages, and injunctive relief concerning the use of \"No Trespass Letters.\" The plaintiffs claimed that the City of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and police officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the amended complaint, the Grand Rapids Police Department (\"GRPD\") had arrested individuals for trespassing based on a City trespass ordinance, under which the City solicits No Trespass Letters from area businesses indicating their intent to prosecute trespassers. The plaintiffs alleged they were arrested for trespassing while sitting in their vehicles in a business's parking lot, without any warning or complaint from the business itself. The plaintiffs claimed their arrests were without probable cause and therefore in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance violated the void-for-vagueness doctrine of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n",
        "Amendment.\n",
        "\n",
        "On December 3, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek declaratory or injunctive relief because they were not suffering an imminent threat of repeated future misconduct. Additionally, defendants argued that the plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were not ripe because the City had changed the No Trespass Letters following the plaintiffs' filling of the Complaint. Defendants did not challenge the Court's jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claim for damages.\n",
        "\n",
        "On August 4, 2014, the Judge Paul L. Maloney dismissed the claims of one of the plaintiffs against the defendants according to the parties' stipulation. However, the other plaintiffs' claims remained.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the motion to dismiss was still pending, the defendants and the plaintiffs both filed motions for summary judgment. In April 2015, the court postponed the trial date pending the resolution of multiple motions made by both the defendants and the plaintiffs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following a hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss, as well as both parties' motions for summary judgment, Judge Maloney granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief on June 21, 2017. 256 F.Supp.3d 742. The Court held that, because the plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to present a threat of an imminent, as opposed to a speculative, injury, they lacked standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The Court also noted that the City's changes to the No Trespass Letters following the filing of this case rendered the requests for prospective relief unripe. The Court did not, however, grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for damages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notably, the Michigan Court of Appeals addressed the same issue of whether the Grand Rapids ordinance is constitutional and held that it is unconstitutional. People v. Maggitt, 903 N.W.2d 868 (Mich. Ct. App. 2017). Following the Michigan Court of Appeals' ruling, the City effectively ended its practice of arresting individuals pursuant to the No Trespass Letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "On October 17, 2018, Judge Maloney held that both sides were entitled to partial summary judgment. 407 F.Supp.3d 707.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on their municipal liability claim against the City of Grand Rapids. The Court found that the City had an unconstitutional policy or custom whereby police officers arrested individuals for trespassing on property covered by a no-trespass letter without first informing the suspect that he or she must leave the property. However, the Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the City's trespass ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.'''\n",
