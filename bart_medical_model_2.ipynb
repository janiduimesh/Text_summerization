In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) w...</td>\n",

METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &amp;#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...</td>\n",

In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...</td>\n",

In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next.

Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.</td>\n",

              "0  INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) w...   \n",
              "1  OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...   \n",
              "2  Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...   \n",
              "3  Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell ma...   \n",
              "4                                The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally. These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.   \n",

We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Conservative management of early-onset severe preeclampsia: comparison between randomized and observational studies a systematic review\",\n          \"Synthesis and characterization of a nano-formulation for long lasting sterilization effect\",\n          \"Update of transmission modelling and projections of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis in the Mandoul focus, Chad\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) w...</td>\n",

METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &amp;#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...</td>\n",

In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...</td>\n",

In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next.

These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.</td>\n",

              "0  INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) w...   \n",
              "1  OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...   \n",
              "2  Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...   \n",
              "3  Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell ma...   \n",
              "4                                The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally. These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.   \n",

BACKGROUND: During the COVID\\u201019 crisis, nurses experience a greater psychological burden than other health care workers. Studies have not yet investigated the effects of years in nursing and mental health on potential work impairment during the COVID\\u201019 crisis in nurses. METHODS: A survey was administered to 83 nurses on active duty during the COVID\\u201019 crisis. The graphical LASSO and the DAG helped estimate the associations between years of nursing experience, mental health and work impairment. RESULTS: A moderate negative correlation emerged between years of nursing experience, avoidance and work impairment. A direct effect was observed between anxiety and work impairment. A moderate positive correlation emerged between anxiety, depression and work impairment. An indirect effect was observed between depression, burnout, insomnia, years of nursing experience and work impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In the present sample, nurses' work impairment decreased with greater years of nursing experience and increased with higher anxiety, depression, burnout and avoidance levels. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: These findings can help design effective infectious disease management programmes for students and professionals in nursing to prevent breakdowns and avoid work impairment.\",\n          \"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens vulnerable patient populations, resulting in immense pressures at the local, regional, national, and international levels to contain the virus. Laboratory-based studies demonstrate that masks may offer benefit in reducing the spread of droplet-based illnesses, but few data are available to assess mask effects via executive order on a population basis. We assess the effects of a county-wide mask order on per-population mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and ventilator utilization in Bexar County, Texas. METHODS: We used publicly reported county-level data to perform a mixed-methods before-and-after analysis along with other sources of public data for analyses of covariance. We used a least-squares regression analysis to adjust for confounders. A Texas state-level mask order was issued on July 3, 2020, followed by a Bexar County\\u2013level order on July 15, 2020. We defined the control period as June 2 to July 2 and the postmask order period as July 8, 2020\\u2013August 12, 2020, with a 5-day gap to account for the median incubation period for cases; longer periods of 7 and 10 days were used for hospitalization and ICU admission/death, respectively. Data are reported on a per-100,000 population basis using respective US Census Bureau\\u2013reported populations. RESULTS: From June 2, 2020 through August 12, 2020, there were 40,771 reported cases of COVID-19 within Bexar County, with 470 total deaths. The average number of new cases per day within the county was 565.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 394.6\\u2013736.2). The average number of positive hospitalized patients was 754.1 (95% CI 657.2\\u2013851.0), in the ICU was 273.1 (95% CI 238.2\\u2013308.0), and on a ventilator was 170.5 (95% CI 146.4\\u2013194.6). The average deaths per day was 6.5 (95% CI 4.4\\u20138.6). All of the measured outcomes were higher on average in the postmask period as were covariables included in the adjusted model. When adjusting for traffic activity, total statewide caseload, public health complaints, and mean temperature, the daily caseload, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy, ventilator occupancy, and daily mortality remained higher in the postmask period. CONCLUSIONS: There was no reduction in per-population daily mortality, hospital bed, ICU bed, or ventilator occupancy of COVID-19-positive patients attributable to the implementation of a mask-wearing mandate.\",\n          \"Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is challenging, and validated diagnostic algorithms are lacking. Therefore, this retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of seven commercial antibody assays for LNB diagnosis. Random forest (RF) modeling was conducted to investigate whether the diagnostic performance using the antibody assays could be improved by including several routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters (i.e., leukocyte count, total protein, blood-CSF barrier functionality, and intrathecal total antibody synthesis), two-tier serology on serum, the CSF level of the B-cell chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), and a Borrelia species PCR on CSF. In total, 156 patients were included who were classified as definite LNB (n = 10), possible LNB (n = 7), or non-LNB patient (n = 139) according to the criteria of the European Federation of Neurological Societies using a consensus strategy for intrathecal Borrelia-specific antibody synthesis. The seven antibody assays showed sensitivities ranging from 47.1% to 100% and specificities ranging from 95.7% to 100%. RF modeling demonstrated that the sensitivities of most antibody assays could be improved by including other parameters to the diagnostic repertoire for diagnosing LNB (range: 94.1% to 100%), although with slightly lower specificities (range: 92.8% to 96.4%). The most important parameters for LNB diagnosis are the detection of intrathecally produced Borrelia-specific antibodies, two-tier serology on serum, CSF-CXCL13, Reibergram classification, and pleocytosis. In conclusion, this study shows that LNB diagnosis is best supported using multiparameter analysis. Furthermore, a collaborative prospective study is proposed to investigate if a standardized diagnostic algorithm can be developed for improved LNB diagnosis.

Respiratory examination revealed minimal basal cracklesbilaterally. Her heart sounds were normal, and there was no carotid orsubclavian bruit. Radial, ulnar, brachial, subclavian and temporalpulses were intact and symmetrical. The abdomen was soft, but tenderover the right upper quadrant and epigastrium. Nailfolds were normal, and there was no livedo reticularis and no vasculitic rash. Initialinvestigations showed a CRP of 235 mg/L (&amp;lt;5), White blood c...</td>\n",

Laboratory-based studies demonstrate that masks may offer benefit in reducing the spread of droplet-based illnesses, but few data are available to assess mask effects via executive order on a population basis. We assess the effects of a county-wide mask order on per-population mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and ventilator utilization in Bexar County, Texas. METHODS: We used publicly reported county-level data to perform a mixed-methods before-and-after analysis along with other sources of public data for analyses of covariance. We used a least-squares regression analysis to adjust for confounders. A Texas state-level mask order was issued on July 3, 2020, followed by a Bexar County–level order on July 15, 2020. We defined the control period as June 2 to July 2 and the postmask...</td>\n",

In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) w...   \n",
            "1       OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...   \n",
            "2       Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...   \n",
            "3       Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell ma...   \n",
            "4                                     The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally. These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.   \n",

            "821006  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens vulnerable patient populations, resulting in immense pressures at the local, regional, national, and international levels to contain the virus. Laboratory-based studies demonstrate that masks may offer benefit in reducing the spread of droplet-based illnesses, but few data are available to assess mask effects via executive order on a population basis. We assess the effects of a county-wide mask order on per-population mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and ventilator utilization in Bexar County, Texas. METHODS: We used publicly reported county-level data to perform a mixed-methods before-and-after analysis along with other sources of public data for analyses of covariance. We used a least-squares regression analysis to adjust for confounders. A Texas state-level mask order was issued on July 3, 2020, followed by a Bexar County–level order on July 15, 2020. We defined the control period as June 2 to July 2 and the postmask...   \n",

METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.\",\n          \"The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally. These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.\",\n          \"Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Conservative management of early-onset severe preeclampsia: comparison between randomized and observational studies a systematic review\",\n          \"Synthesis and characterization of a nano-formulation for long lasting sterilization effect\",\n          \"Update of transmission modelling and projections of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis in the Mandoul focus, Chad\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...</td>\n",

In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...</td>\n",

In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell ma...</td>\n",

These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.</td>\n",

              "0  INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) w...   \n",
              "1  OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...   \n",
              "2  Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...   \n",
              "3  Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell ma...   \n",
              "4                                The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally. These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.   \n",

BACKGROUND: During the COVID\\u201019 crisis, nurses experience a greater psychological burden than other health care workers. Studies have not yet investigated the effects of years in nursing and mental health on potential work impairment during the COVID\\u201019 crisis in nurses. METHODS: A survey was administered to 83 nurses on active duty during the COVID\\u201019 crisis. The graphical LASSO and the DAG helped estimate the associations between years of nursing experience, mental health and work impairment. RESULTS: A moderate negative correlation emerged between years of nursing experience, avoidance and work impairment. A direct effect was observed between anxiety and work impairment. A moderate positive correlation emerged between anxiety, depression and work impairment. An indirect effect was observed between depression, burnout, insomnia, years of nursing experience and work impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In the present sample, nurses' work impairment decreased with greater years of nursing experience and increased with higher anxiety, depression, burnout and avoidance levels. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: These findings can help design effective infectious disease management programmes for students and professionals in nursing to prevent breakdowns and avoid work impairment.\",\n          \"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens vulnerable patient populations, resulting in immense pressures at the local, regional, national, and international levels to contain the virus. Laboratory-based studies demonstrate that masks may offer benefit in reducing the spread of droplet-based illnesses, but few data are available to assess mask effects via executive order on a population basis. We assess the effects of a county-wide mask order on per-population mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and ventilator utilization in Bexar County, Texas. METHODS: We used publicly reported county-level data to perform a mixed-methods before-and-after analysis along with other sources of public data for analyses of covariance. We used a least-squares regression analysis to adjust for confounders. A Texas state-level mask order was issued on July 3, 2020, followed by a Bexar County\\u2013level order on July 15, 2020. We defined the control period as June 2 to July 2 and the postmask order period as July 8, 2020\\u2013August 12, 2020, with a 5-day gap to account for the median incubation period for cases; longer periods of 7 and 10 days were used for hospitalization and ICU admission/death, respectively. Data are reported on a per-100,000 population basis using respective US Census Bureau\\u2013reported populations. RESULTS: From June 2, 2020 through August 12, 2020, there were 40,771 reported cases of COVID-19 within Bexar County, with 470 total deaths. The average number of new cases per day within the county was 565.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 394.6\\u2013736.2). The average number of positive hospitalized patients was 754.1 (95% CI 657.2\\u2013851.0), in the ICU was 273.1 (95% CI 238.2\\u2013308.0), and on a ventilator was 170.5 (95% CI 146.4\\u2013194.6). The average deaths per day was 6.5 (95% CI 4.4\\u20138.6). All of the measured outcomes were higher on average in the postmask period as were covariables included in the adjusted model. When adjusting for traffic activity, total statewide caseload, public health complaints, and mean temperature, the daily caseload, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy, ventilator occupancy, and daily mortality remained higher in the postmask period. CONCLUSIONS: There was no reduction in per-population daily mortality, hospital bed, ICU bed, or ventilator occupancy of COVID-19-positive patients attributable to the implementation of a mask-wearing mandate.\",\n          \"Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is challenging, and validated diagnostic algorithms are lacking. Therefore, this retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of seven commercial antibody assays for LNB diagnosis. Random forest (RF) modeling was conducted to investigate whether the diagnostic performance using the antibody assays could be improved by including several routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters (i.e., leukocyte count, total protein, blood-CSF barrier functionality, and intrathecal total antibody synthesis), two-tier serology on serum, the CSF level of the B-cell chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), and a Borrelia species PCR on CSF. In total, 156 patients were included who were classified as definite LNB (n = 10), possible LNB (n = 7), or non-LNB patient (n = 139) according to the criteria of the European Federation of Neurological Societies using a consensus strategy for intrathecal Borrelia-specific antibody synthesis. The seven antibody assays showed sensitivities ranging from 47.1% to 100% and specificities ranging from 95.7% to 100%. RF modeling demonstrated that the sensitivities of most antibody assays could be improved by including other parameters to the diagnostic repertoire for diagnosing LNB (range: 94.1% to 100%), although with slightly lower specificities (range: 92.8% to 96.4%). The most important parameters for LNB diagnosis are the detection of intrathecally produced Borrelia-specific antibodies, two-tier serology on serum, CSF-CXCL13, Reibergram classification, and pleocytosis. In conclusion, this study shows that LNB diagnosis is best supported using multiparameter analysis. Furthermore, a collaborative prospective study is proposed to investigate if a standardized diagnostic algorithm can be developed for improved LNB diagnosis.

The lack of prior immunity to the virus has resulted in a high mortality rate, though children have fared better than adults, overall. We present a case of a child who developed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 week following a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. It is possible that this viral infection provided the \"second hit\" posited to occur in pediatric leukemogenesis as proposed by Dr Greaves, with his initial viral exposure occurring several weeks earlier.   \n",
              "821003  AIM: To investigate the effects of years of nursing experience and mental health on work impairment among nurses during the COVID‐19 crisis. BACKGROUND: During the COVID‐19 crisis, nurses experience a greater psychological burden than other health care workers. Studies have not yet investigated the effects of years in nursing and mental health on potential work impairment during the COVID‐19 crisis in nurses. METHODS: A survey was administered to 83 nurses on active duty during the COVID‐19 crisis. The graphical LASSO and the DAG helped estimate the associations between years of nursing experience, mental health and work impairment. RESULTS: A moderate negative correlation emerged between years of nursing experience, avoidance and work impairment. A direct effect was observed between anxiety and work impairment. A moderate positive correlation emerged between anxiety, depression and work impairment. An indirect effect was observed between depression, burnout, insomnia, years of nur...   \n",
              "821004  Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is challenging, and validated diagnostic algorithms are lacking. Therefore, this retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of seven commercial antibody assays for LNB diagnosis. Random forest (RF) modeling was conducted to investigate whether the diagnostic performance using the antibody assays could be improved by including several routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters (i.e., leukocyte count, total protein, blood-CSF barrier functionality, and intrathecal total antibody synthesis), two-tier serology on serum, the CSF level of the B-cell chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), and a Borrelia species PCR on CSF. In total, 156 patients were included who were classified as definite LNB (n = 10), possible LNB (n = 7), or non-LNB patient (n = 139) according to the criteria of the European Federation of Neurological Societies using a consensus strategy for intrathecal Borrelia-specific an...   \n",

              "821006  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens vulnerable patient populations, resulting in immense pressures at the local, regional, national, and international levels to contain the virus. Laboratory-based studies demonstrate that masks may offer benefit in reducing the spread of droplet-based illnesses, but few data are available to assess mask effects via executive order on a population basis. We assess the effects of a county-wide mask order on per-population mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and ventilator utilization in Bexar County, Texas. METHODS: We used publicly reported county-level data to perform a mixed-methods before-and-after analysis along with other sources of public data for analyses of covariance. We used a least-squares regression analysis to adjust for confounders. A Texas state-level mask order was issued on July 3, 2020, followed by a Bexar County–level order on July 15, 2020.

METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.\",\n          \"The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally. These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.\",\n          \"Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Conservative management of early-onset severe preeclampsia: comparison between randomized and observational studies a systematic review\",\n          \"Synthesis and characterization of a nano-formulation for long lasting sterilization effect\",\n          \"Update of transmission modelling and projections of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis in the Mandoul focus, Chad\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth.

              "0  INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) w...   \n",
              "1  OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also sign...   \n",
              "2  Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for ...   \n",
              "3  Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell ma...   \n",
              "4                                The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally. These available alcohol based sanitisers cannot provide an antibacterial effect for an extended period of time, after the evaporation of ethanol. Hence, the need for a sanitiser with an anti-microbial activity combined with a long lasting effect is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the synthesis of a long lasting sanitiser from ozonated omega 9 fatty acid esters in an ethanolic medium. The formed vesicles made of the fatty acids have been characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies. Ethanol although, provides an antibacterial effect, the effect is more pronounced in our prepared formulation owing to its high peroxide value that generates additional oxidative stress. Finally, this additional antimicrobial effect will have relevance in the current COVID-19 scenario in providing a long lasting hand sanitiser.   \n",

METHODS: This prospective cohort study comprised 31 mild or moderate confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients and 26 age-matched control peers (21\\u201350 years old). Patients were questioned about their otological symptoms, and their hearing status was assessed during one month post-diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients showed a significantly higher rate of otological symptoms (hearing loss, ear fullness, ear pain, dizziness or vertigo, communication difficulties, and hyperacusis) versus the control group (p \\u2264 0.022). The symptoms resolved early, between 2 and 8 days after their appearance. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in pure tone and extended high-frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, or auditory brainstem response following recovery. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that, in mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 cases, otological symptoms resolve within a week, and the virus has no lasting impact on the auditory system.\",\n          \"We demonstrate that universal scaling behavior is observed in the current coronavirus (COVID-19) spread in various countries.

It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating th...</td>\n",

A new dimension to this debate is whether COVID-19 will be the catalyst for higher IA adoption levels. This article reviews arguments in favour of COVID-19 increasing the level of IA adoption and possible counter-arguments. Key arguments in favour of increased IA adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour IA, increasing familiarity of IA technologies, and increased business confidence in IA. Counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over IA, the narrow capabilities of IA technologies, and a high availability of human workers. ...</td>\n",

              "10004  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease characterized by strong induction of inflammatory cytokines, progressive lung inflammation and potentially multi-organ dysfunction. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating th...   \n",

African populations are increasingly using social networks and this may have benefits but also harmful consequences, especially at this time of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This paper concisely discusses of these consequences which include the propagation of “fake news” and the misinterpretation of messages pertaining to the prevention and the treatment of the disease. Moreover, our commentary provides some ways to alleviate them, chiefly represented by a framed and practical communication by health authorities. We suggest for instance the systematic sharing of correct messages through official Facebook and Twitter accounts and the conception of tailored web tools dedicated to the verification of circulating information.   \n",
              "10006  We demonstrate that universal scaling behavior is observed in the current coronavirus (COVID-19) spread in various countries. We analyze the numbers of infected people in selected eleven countries (Japan, USA, Russia, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia, Spain,South Korea, UK, and Sweden). By using the double exponential function called the Gompertz function, fG(x)=exp(-e-x), the number of infected people is well described as N(t)=N0 fG({gamma}(t-t0)), where N0, {gamma} and t0 are the final total number of infected people, the damping rate of the infection probability and the peak time of dN(t)/dt, respectively. The scaled data of infected people in most of the analyzed countries are found to collapse onto a common scaling function fG(x) with x={gamma}(t-t0) in the range of fG(x) {+/-} 0.05. The recently proposed indicator so-called the K value, the increasing rate of infected people in one week, is also found to show universal behavior. The mechanism for the Gompertz function to appea...   \n",
              "10007  As part of the urgent need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, healthcare providers, and businesses have looked to applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to compensate for the unavailability of human workers. This interest has renewed the debate regarding the use of AI for the automation of work, which has been described as Intelligent Automation (IA). A new dimension to this debate is whether COVID-19 will be the catalyst for higher IA adoption levels. This article reviews arguments in favour of COVID-19 increasing the level of IA adoption and possible counter-arguments. Key arguments in favour of increased IA adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour IA, increasing familiarity of IA technologies, and increased business confidence in IA. Counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over IA, the narrow capabilities of IA technologies, and a high availability of human workers. ...   \n",
              "10008  OBJECTIVE: Otological complications are considered early symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; however, it is unknown how long these symptoms last and whether the virus leaves any hearing disorders post-recovery. METHODS: This prospective cohort study comprised 31 mild or moderate confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients and 26 age-matched control peers (21–50 years old). Patients were questioned about their otological symptoms, and their hearing status was assessed during one month post-diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients showed a significantly higher rate of otological symptoms (hearing loss, ear fullness, ear pain, dizziness or vertigo, communication difficulties, and hyperacusis) versus the control group (p ≤ 0.022). The symptoms resolved early, between 2 and 8 days after their appearance. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in pure tone and extended high-frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, distortion prod...   \n",

(3) To determine the determinants of the resilience of persons with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. To measure the resilience of persons with disabilities, researchers used The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) developed by Connor and Davidson. This study uses a survey method with a quantitative approach, involving a research sample of 137 people with disabilities who are members of the Rise Together United (PBB) organization and the Yogyakarta Paraplegic Association (P3Y) in Bantul Regency. Data retrieval with questionnaires distributed by google form via WhatsApps. Data analysis using SPSS version 26 software, with descriptive analysis, frequency analysis and factor analysis. The results showed that the resilience of persons with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic was in the high (52.6%) and moderate (47.4%) categories. The determinants of resilience are (1) external factors in the high category (68.6%) and medium category (31.4%);(2) internal factors in the high (45.3%) and medium (54.7%). It concludes that the most significant influence on the resilience of persons with disabilities is external factors, namely the carrying capacity of family, friends in organizations, neighbours, government policies, and NGO assistance.\",\n          \"Historically, economic changes have negatively affected the nursing workforce in Ontario.

Unfortunately, practical transportation systems have dynamic, multi-attribute costs and the state-of-the-art technical approaches proposed in the literature are infeasible for practical deployment. In this paper, we offer a paradigm shift to selfish routing via characterizing idiosyncratic, multi-attribute costs at boundedly-rational travelers, as well as improving network efficiency using strategic information design. Specifically, we model the interaction between the system and travelers as a Stackelberg game, where travelers adopt multi-attribute logit responses. We model the strategic information design as an optimization problem, and develop a novel approximate algorithm to steer Logit Response travelers towards social welfa...</td>\n",

In a minority of patients, extrapulmonary organs (central nervous system, eyes, heart, and gut) are affected, with detection of viral RNA in bodily secretions (stool, tears, and saliva). Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals. It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment.

              "8596  Traditional selfish routing literature quantifies inefficiency in transportation systems with single-attribute costs using price-of-anarchy (PoA), and provides various technical approaches (e.g. marginal cost pricing) to improve PoA of the overall network. Unfortunately, practical transportation systems have dynamic, multi-attribute costs and the state-of-the-art technical approaches proposed in the literature are infeasible for practical deployment. In this paper, we offer a paradigm shift to selfish routing via characterizing idiosyncratic, multi-attribute costs at boundedly-rational travelers, as well as improving network efficiency using strategic information design. Specifically, we model the interaction between the system and travelers as a Stackelberg game, where travelers adopt multi-attribute logit responses. We model the strategic information design as an optimization problem, and develop a novel approximate algorithm to steer Logit Response travelers towards social welfa...   \n",

              "5205  Historically, economic changes have negatively affected the nursing workforce in Ontario. The trend towards part-time and casual employment emerged from healthcare restructuring in the 1990s. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 alerted the Ontario government to the issue of part-time and casual nursing. In 2007, the Nursing Graduate Guarantee (NGG), a health human resources employment policy, was developed as a financial incentive for employers to hire and mentor new graduate nurses for a six-month period. The purpose of this study was to examine facilitators and barriers to policy implementation and assess the impact of the NGG on full-time employment and workforce integration of new graduate nurses in Ontario. A mixed-methods approach was used and included surveys, interviews and focus groups. Results indicated that full-time employment of new graduate nurses increased during the study period and that mentorship facilitated workforce integration of new g...   \n",
              "8897  The ongoing pandemic COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has already resulted in more than 3 million cases and more than 200,000 deaths globally. Significant clinical presentations of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms and pneumonia. In a minority of patients, extrapulmonary organs (central nervous system, eyes, heart, and gut) are affected, with detection of viral RNA in bodily secretions (stool, tears, and saliva). Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals. It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accesso...   \n",

They often turn to their physicians for help navigating health costs and insurance coverage. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physicians can accurately estimate out-of-pocket expenses when they are given all of the necessary information about a drug\\u2019s price and a patient\\u2019s insurance plan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This national mail-in survey used a random sample of US physicians. The survey was sent to 900 outpatient physicians (300 each of primary care, gastroenterology, and rheumatology). Physicians were excluded if they were in training, worked primarily for the Veterans Administration or Indian Health Service, were retired, or reported 0% outpatient clinical effort. Analyses were performed from July to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In a hypothetical vignette, a patient was prescribed a new drug costing $1000/month without insurance. A summary of her private insurance information was provided, including the plan\\u2019s deductible, coinsurance rates, copays, and out-of-pocket maximum. Physicians were asked to estimate the drug\\u2019s out-of-pocket cost at 4 time points between January and December, using the plan\\u2019s 4 types of cost-sharing: (1) deductibles, (2) coinsurance, (3) copays, and (4) out-of-pocket maximums. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess differences in performance by specialty, adjusting for attitudes toward cost conversations, demographics, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The response rate was 45% (405 of 900) and 371 respondents met inclusion criteria. Among the respondents included in this study, 59% (n = 220) identified as male, 23% (n = 84) as Asian, 3% (n = 12) as Black, 6% (n = 24) as Hispanic, and 58% (n = 216) as White; 30% (n = 112) were primary care physicians, 35% (n = 128) were gastroenterologists, and 35% (n = 131) were rheumatologists; and the mean (SD) age was 49 (10) years. Overall, 52% of physicians (n = 192) accurately estimated costs before the deductible was met, 62% (n = 228) accurately used coinsurance information, 61% (n = 224) accurately used copay information, and 57% (n = 210) accurately estimated costs once the out-of-pocket maximum was met. Only 21% (n = 78) of physicians answered all 4 questions correctly. Ability to estimate out-of-pocket costs was not associated with specialty, attitudes toward cost conversations, or clinic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study found that many US physicians have difficulty estimating out-of-pocket costs, even when they have access to their patients' insurance plans. The mechanics involved in calculating real-time out-of-pocket costs are complex. These findings suggest that increased price transparency and simpler insurance cost-sharing mechanisms are needed to enable informed cost conversations at the point of prescribing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"17\\u03b2-Estradiol, a potential ally to alleviate SARS-CoV-2 infection\",\n          \"Deep convolutional neural networks approach for classification of lung diseases using x-rays: Covid-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis\",\n          \"Accuracy of Physician Estimates of Out-of-Pocket Costs for Medication Filling\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

A total of 68 critical patients with sepsis and septic shock in the intensive care unit and 20 outpatients (control group) with COVID-19 were taken. ICU patients (n = 68) were further divided into three groups.

Presepsin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein results were compared between the groups.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physicians can accurately estimate out-of-pocket expenses when they are given all of the necessary information about a drug’s price and a patient’s insurance plan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This national mail-in survey used a random sample of US physicians. The survey was sent to 900 outpatient physicians (300 each of primary care, gastroenterology, and rheumatology). Physicians were excluded if they were in training, worked primarily for the Veterans Administration or Indian Health Service, were retired, or reported 0% outpatient clinical effort. Analyses were performed from July to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In a hypothetical vignette, a patient was prescribed a new drug costing $1000/month without insurance.

We found that 2-doses of self-amplifying RNA vaccine based on the ancestral spike ameliorated weight loss following Delta infection and decreased viral loads, but had minimal effect on Omicron/BA.1 infection. Prior infection with ancestral or Alpha variant was partially protective against Omicron/BA.1 infection, whereas all animals previously infected with Delta and exposed to Omicron became infected, although shed less virus.

A total of 68 critical patients with sepsis and septic shock in the intensive care unit and 20 outpatients (control group) with COVID-19 were taken. ICU patients (n = 68) were further divided into three groups. C(-)AT(-) had negative blood or tracheal aspirate cultures (C) and not AT on admission to ICU (n = 18), C(-)AT(+) had negative C and AT on admission to intensive care unit (n = 31) and C(+) had positive C (n = 19). Presepsin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein results were compared between the groups. There were no significant relationships between presepsin levels with sepsis, septic shock, mortality, or length of stay in ICU in patients with COVID-19.

              "5273  IMPORTANCE: One-third of US residents have trouble paying their medical bills. They often turn to their physicians for help navigating health costs and insurance coverage. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physicians can accurately estimate out-of-pocket expenses when they are given all of the necessary information about a drug’s price and a patient’s insurance plan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This national mail-in survey used a random sample of US physicians. The survey was sent to 900 outpatient physicians (300 each of primary care, gastroenterology, and rheumatology). Physicians were excluded if they were in training, worked primarily for the Veterans Administration or Indian Health Service, were retired, or reported 0% outpatient clinical effort. Analyses were performed from July to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In a hypothetical vignette, a patient was prescribed a new drug costing $1000/month without insurance. A summary of her private insurance information...   \n",
              "9675  The second and third years of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been marked by the repeated emergence and replacement of variants with genetic and phenotypic distance from the ancestral strains, the most recent examples being Delta and Omicron. Here we describe a hamster contact exposure challenge model to assess protection conferred by vaccination or prior infection against re-infection. We found that 2-doses of self-amplifying RNA vaccine based on the ancestral spike ameliorated weight loss following Delta infection and decreased viral loads, but had minimal effect on Omicron/BA.1 infection. Prior infection with ancestral or Alpha variant was partially protective against Omicron/BA.1 infection, whereas all animals previously infected with Delta and exposed to Omicron became infected, although shed less virus. We further tested whether prior infection with Omicron/BA.1 protected from re-infection with Delta or Omicron/BA.2. Omicron/BA.1 was protective against Omicron/BA.2, but not Delt...   \n",

We aimed to study trends in lifestyle habits among community-dwelling older people. METHODS This retrospective time-trend study enrolled 429 108 participants from the Senior Citizen Health Examination in Taiwan over ten years (2001-2010). We analysed lifestyle habits including smoking, alcohol, betel nut chewing, milk drinking, fruit and vegetable intake, car driving and motorcycle riding. Joinpoint regression was used to identify changes in trend. RESULTS The overall rate of smoking, alcohol and betel nut chewing was 8.2%, 18.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Smoking rates decreased gradually, but alcohol and betel nut chewing increased. We found that milk drinking, fruit and vegetable intake and car driving initially increased and then later decreased. The change in the trend was in 2003. CONCLUSION There were significant turning points in milk drinking, fruit and vegetable intake and car driving. Implementation of strategies to change the behaviors of citizens about the intake of fruit and vegetable and milk drinking is important.\",\n          \"Background: Children and young adults were initially reported as largely spared from severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the impact to this population has been significant Methods: This observational retrospective cohort study includes 420 symptomatic children and young adults with lab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated between March 15 and June 16, 2020 at Children's National Hospital in Washington DC We identified and compared cohorts of non-hospitalized (N=324) and hospitalized (N=96) patients, including non-critically ill (N=64) and critically ill hospitalized (N=32) patients Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records Results: Of 420 SARS-CoV-2-infected symptomatic patients, 23% required hospitalization, of which 67% were non-critically ill and 33% were critically ill All age groups were represented in the symptomatic cohort, with a median age of 8 6 years Patients &gt; 15 years of age represented 44% of critical care admissions Males and females were equally represented in all cohorts Underlying medical conditions were present in 36%, but more common in hospitalized (59 %) and critically ill (66 %) patients The most frequent underlying diagnosis overall was asthma (16 %), but also included neurologic (6 %), diabetes (3 %), obesity (3 %), cardiac (3 %), hematologic (3 %) and oncologic (1 %) conditions The majority (66 %) of SARSCoV- 2 infected patients presented with respiratory symptoms with or without fever Other symptoms were also present, including diarrhea/vomiting (21 %), myalgia (11 %), chest pain (8 %) and loss of sense of smell or taste (7%) Hospitalized patients required varying levels of respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation, BiPAP, RAM cannula and HFNC Additional presentations included diabetic hyperglycemia, sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis, vascular complications, and multisystem inflammation Treatment included remdesivir, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab and other therapies Conclusion: Although children/young adults have been less affected than elderly adults, the impact of SARS-CoV2 on this population has been significant in Washington DC and informs other regions anticipating their surge\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Recurrent thrombosis as a clinical presentation of Whipple disease.\",\n          \"Ten-year trends in lifestyle habits among community-dwelling older people in Taiwan.\",\n          \"Severe COVID-19 in children and young adults in the Washington DC metropolitan region\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen using a novel TCR-binding algorithm. The predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epit...</td>\n",

              "6258  The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a range of disease phenotypes in infected patients with asymptomatic, mild, or severe clinical outcomes, but the mechanisms that determine such variable outcomes remain unresolved. In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen using a novel TCR-binding algorithm. The predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epit...   \n",

Associated thrombotic manifestations are not well described in WD, only related to 'stroke-like syndrome'. We present a case of a 39-year-old man with a 1-year history of self-limited episodes of fever, associated with generalised adenopathies and recurrent superficial and deep venous thrombosis events, which have resorted four times despite the anticoagulant treatment. Finally, the patient is diagnosed with WD. Following treatment the patient improved in his general condition, and no more episodes of fever neither thrombosis appeared during a follow-up of more than 3 years.   \n",

This multinational study of LATAM youth examined the distinguishing features of acute or late multisystem SARS COV2 with versus without cardiac involvement. A consecutive sample of youth 0–18 years old (N = 98;50% male) presenting with multisystem SARS COV2 to 32 centers in 10 Latin American countries participating in a pediatric cardiac multi-imaging society were grouped as with versus without cardiac involvement, defined as abnormal echocardiographic findings or arrhythmia. Collected clinical data were analyzed by Student’s t-test or Fisher’s exact test. Cardiac (N = 48, 50% male) versus no cardiac (N = 50, 50% male) were similar in age; weight; nonrespiratory symptoms; and medical history. The cardiac group had 1 death and symp...   \n",

METHODS This retrospective time-trend study enrolled 429 108 participants from the Senior Citizen Health Examination in Taiwan over ten years (2001-2010). We analysed lifestyle habits including smoking, alcohol, betel nut chewing, milk drinking, fruit and vegetable intake, car driving and motorcycle riding. Joinpoint regression was used to identify changes in trend. RESULTS The overall rate of smoking, alcohol and betel nut chewing was 8.2%, 18.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Smoking rates decreased gradually, but alcohol and betel nut chewing increased. We found that milk drinking, fruit and vegetable intake and car driving initially increased and then later decreased. The change in the trend was in 2003. CONCLUSION There were significant turning points in milk drinking, fruit and vegetable intake and car driving. I...   \n",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study including COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Additionally, we performed a univariate analysis of 85 pre-ECMO variables to identify factors influencing incidences of thromboembolic events (TEE) and bleeding events (BE), respectively. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included; the median age was 57 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 51.5-62), 11 patients were males (65%), median ECMO duration was 16 days (IQR: 10.5-22), and the overall survival was 53%. Twelve patients (71%) developed TEBE. We observed 7 patients (41%) who developed TEE and 10 patients (59%) with BE. Upper respiratory tract (URT) bleeding was the most frequent BE with eight cases (47%). Regarding TEE, pulmonary artery embolism (PAE) had the highest incidence with five cases (29%). The comparison of diverse pre-ECMO variables between patients with and without TEBE detected one statistically significant value. The platelet count was significantly lower in the BE group (n = 10) than in the non-BE group (n = 7) with 209 (IQR: 145-238) versus 452 G/L (IQR: 240-560), with p = 0.007. CONCLUSION: This study describes the incidences of TEE and BE in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. The most common adverse event during ECMO support was bleeding, which occurred at a comparable rate to non-COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO.\",\n          \"Introduction: Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum with injury to the functional loop of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT) can trigger a series of events that result in secondary trans-synaptic neurodegeneration of the inferior olivary nucleus. In an unknown percentage of patients, this leads to a condition called hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD). Characteristic clinical symptoms of HOD progress slowly over months and consist of a rhythmic palatal tremor, vertical pendular nystagmus, and Holmes tremor of the upper limbs. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) with tractography is a promising method to identify functional pathway lesions along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity and to generate a deeper understanding of the HOD pathophysiology. The incidence of HOD development following stroke and the timeline of clinical symptoms have not yet been determined in prospective studies\\u2014a prerequisite for the surveillance of patients at risk. Methods and Analysis: Patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum with a topo-anatomical relation to the GMT are recruited within certified stroke units of the Interdisciplinary Neurovascular Network of the Rhine-Main. Matching lesions are identified using a predefined MRI template. Eligible patients are prospectively followed up and present at 4 and 8 months after the index event. During study visits, a clinical neurological examination and brain MRI, including high-resolution T2-, proton-density-weighted imaging, and DTI tractography, are performed. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing is optional if palatal tremor is encountered. Study Outcomes: The primary endpoint of this prospective clinical multicenter study is to determine the frequency of radiological HOD development in patients with a posterior fossa stroke affecting the GMT at 8 months after the index event. Secondary endpoints are identification of (1) the timeline and relevance of clinical symptoms, (2) lesion localizations more prone to HOD occurrence, and (3) the best MR-imaging regimen for HOD identification. Additionally, (4) DTI tractography data are used to analyze individual pathway lesions. The aim is to contribute to the epidemiological and pathophysiological understanding of HOD and hereby facilitate future research on therapeutic and prophylactic measures.

Medium to large selectivity differences between regioisomers, were observed on the acidic, neutral and basic SFC phases. For individual substituted ortho-, meta- and para-isomers, the same elution order was observed irrespective of the nature of the stationary phase. The acidic silica stationary phases yielded longer retention of the diphenidines via electrostatic attraction, whereas the basic phases resulted in shorter retention via electrostatic repulsion. SFC effected baseline separation of seven of the eight substituted groups of ortho-, meta- and para-diphenidines evaluated on a range of stationary phases. A simple silica phase achieved baseline separation of six of the regioisomeric substituted diphenidines. As the size of the halo-substituent increased, the resolution between ortho-/meta-isomers decreased, resulting in co-elution of the ortho- and meta-bromodiphenidines. Fluphenidines and chlorodiphenidines generated an elution order of meta- < ortho- < para- whereas an elution order switch was observed for the iodophenidines. This contrasted with RP-UHPLC where the elution order for the fluphenidines and iodophenidines was para- < ortho- < meta- and para- < meta- < ortho- respectively. An orthogonal elution order of diphenidines was demonstrated between the RP-UHPLC and SFC stationary phases due to the polarity differences between the separation modes. In general, hydrophilic compounds, which were poorly retained on a C18 reverse phase column, were well retained on SFC columns.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in COVID-19 Patients receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation\",\n          \"Multicenter Prospective Analysis of Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration Following Infratentorial Stroke (HOD-IS): Evaluation of Disease Epidemiology, Clinical Presentation, and MR-Imaging Aspects\",\n          \"Guilty by dissociation: Part B: evaluation of Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC-UV) for the analysis of regioisomeric diphenidine-derived Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

              "8292  BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potential treatment option in critically ill COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if mechanical ventilation (MV) is insufficient; however, thromboembolic and bleeding events (TEBE) during ECMO treatment still need to be investigated. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study including COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Additionally, we performed a univariate analysis of 85 pre-ECMO variables to identify factors influencing incidences of thromboembolic events (TEE) and bleeding events (BE), respectively. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included; the median age was 57 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 51.5-62), 11 patients were males (65%), median ECMO duration was 16 days (IQR: 10.5-22), and the overall survival was 53%. Twelve patients (71%) developed TEBE. We observed 7 patients (41%) who developed TEE and 10 patients (59%) with BE. Upper respiratory tract (URT) b...   \n",

Medium to large selectivity differences between regioisomers, were observed on the acidic, neutral and basic SFC phases. For individual substituted ortho-, meta- and para-isomers, the same elution order was observed irrespective of the nature of the stationary phase. The acidic silica stationary phases yielded longer retention of the diphenidines via electrostatic attraction, whereas the basic phases resulted in shorter retention via electrostatic repulsion. SFC effected baseline separation of seven of the eight substituted groups of ortho-, meta- and para-diphenidines evaluated on a range of stationary phases. A simple silica phase achieved baseline separation of six of the regioiso...   \n",

The effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against this variant is not fully understood. Methods Using data from a recent large-scale outbreak of B.1.617.2 SARS-COV-2 infection in Jiangsu, China, we conducted a real-world study to explore the effect of inactivated vaccine immunization on the course of disease in patients infected with the Delta variant. Results Out of 476 patients with B.1.617.2 infection, 184 were unvaccinated, 105 were partially vaccinated, and 187 were fully vaccinated. Forty-two (8.8%) patients developed severe illness, of which 27 (14.7%), 13 (12.4%), and 2 (1.1%) were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated, respectively (P <0.001). All 15 (3.2%) patients who required mechanical ventilation were unvaccinated. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, fully vaccinated patients had an 88% reduced risk of progressing to severe illnes...   \n",
              "6935  Introduction: Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum with injury to the functional loop of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT) can trigger a series of events that result in secondary trans-synaptic neurodegeneration of the inferior olivary nucleus. In an unknown percentage of patients, this leads to a condition called hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD). Characteristic clinical symptoms of HOD progress slowly over months and consist of a rhythmic palatal tremor, vertical pendular nystagmus, and Holmes tremor of the upper limbs. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) with tractography is a promising method to identify functional pathway lesions along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity and to generate a deeper understanding of the HOD pathophysiology. The incidence of HOD development following stroke and the timeline of clinical symptoms have not yet been determined in prospective studies—a prerequisite for the surveillance of patients at risk.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults &amp;#8805;65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no dif...</td>\n",

There is limited data comparing the diagnostic yield of different FNA needles. We aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of four commercially available 19-gauge FNA needles. METHODS Four FNA needles and one percutaneous needle were used to perform liver biopsies on two human cadaveric livers: Cook Echotip Procore™, Olympus EZ Shot 2™, Boston Scientific Expect Slimline™, Covidien SharkCore™, and an 18-gauge percutaneous needle (TruCore™, Argon Medical Devices). Each needle obtained biopsies by three, six, and nine complete back-and-forth motions of the needle (\"throw\") with a fanning technique. The combined lengths of specimen fragments and the total number of complete portal tracts (CPT) were measured by a blinded pathologist. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction were used for statistic...</td>\n",

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults &#8805;65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no dif...   \n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with previously untreated cT1 or cT2 gastric adenocarcinomas  4 cm. We observed no serious adverse effects related to endoscopic tracer injection or the SN mapping procedure. CONCLUSION The endoscopic dual tracer method for SN biopsy was confirmed as safe and effective when applied to the superficial, relatively small gastric adenocarcinomas included in this study.   \n",

There is limited data comparing the diagnostic yield of different FNA needles. We aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of four commercially available 19-gauge FNA needles. METHODS Four FNA needles and one percutaneous needle were used to perform liver biopsies on two human cadaveric livers: Cook Echotip Procore™, Olympus EZ Shot 2™, Boston Scientific Expect Slimline™, Covidien SharkCore™, and an 18-gauge percutaneous needle (TruCore™, Argon Medical Devices). Each needle obtained biopsies by three, six, and nine complete back-and-forth motions of the needle (\"throw\") with a fanning technique. The combined lengths of specimen fragments and the total number of complete portal tracts (CPT) were measured by a blinded pathologist.

              "1461  In a study exploring the origins of cognitive dissonance, preschoolers and capuchins were given a choice between two equally preferred alternatives (two different stickers and two differently colored M&M's, respectively). On the basis of previous research with adults, this choice was thought to cause dissonance because it conflicted with subjects' belief that the two options were equally valuable. We therefore expected subjects to change their attitude toward the unchosen alternative, deeming it less valuable. We then presented subjects with a choice between the unchosen option and an option that was originally as attractive as both options in the first choice. Both groups preferred the novel over the unchosen option in this experimental condition, but not in a control condition in which they did not take part in the first decision. These results provide the first evidence of decision rationalization in children and nonhuman primates. They suggest that the mechanisms underlying cog...   \n",

The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), non-atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12). Serum levels of IL-5, IL-13, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 were measured at admission and at recovery using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were elevated in group I compared with the other groups at both admission phase and clinical recovery phase. In group I, serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were higher at recovery phase than at admission phase (VEGF: 1,102.2\\u00b1569.4 vs. 874.9\\u00b1589.9 pg/mL, respectively; IL-5: 150.5\\u00b163.9 vs. 120.2\\u00b146.7 pg/mL, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased in atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia than in the other groups. In this group, the serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased at recovery phase than at admission phase. The results of this study suggest that increases in VEGF and IL-5 may contribute to the development of hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia infection. These cytokines may act through their respective pro-inflammatory pathways to aggravate the allergic status and induce airway hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia pneumonia in atopic children.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neural-IR-Explorer: A Content-Focused Tool to Explore Neural Re-ranking Results\",\n          \"Official Information Act investigation of the Ministry of Health's process to assess the Southern District Health Board's readiness to join the National Bowel Screening Programme in 2018\",\n          \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infection Affects the Serum Levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Interleukin-5 in Atopic Children\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Ivermectin, an avermectin derivative, is used as a treatment for parasitic infections in humans and domesticated animals.Discussion: Ivermectin's mechanism of action involves binding to ligand-gated ion channel receptors including glutamate, GABA, and glycine, resulting in parasitic paralysis and death. Due to varying expression of these ion channel receptors in vertebrate species, ivermectin toxicity is rarely reported in mammals. Ivermectin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein, which limits its neurological toxicity in humans. Genetic polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein or coadministration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors may increase the neurotoxicity of ivermectin. Other toxic effects of ivermectin after therapeutic oral use include edema, rash, headache, and ocular complaints. Most of these effects are mild and short in duration. Iverme...</td>\n",

The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), non-atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12). Serum levels of IL-5, IL-13, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured at admission and at recovery u...</td>\n",

On the other hand, the domain of animation faces has been studied less intensively due to the absence of a well-organized dataset. In this paper, we present a large-scale animation celebfaces dataset (AnimeCeleb) via controllable synthetic animation models to boost research on the animation face domain. To facilitate the data generation process, we build a semi-automatic pipeline based on an open 3D software and a developed annotation system. This leads to constructing a large-scale animation face dataset that includes multi-pose and multi-style animation faces with rich annotations. Experiments suggest that our dataset is applicable to various animation-related tasks such as head reenactment and colorization.</td>\n",

              "2837  Introduction: Avermectins are common antiparasitic drugs, derived from Streptomyces bacteria that exhibit activity against arthropods and nematodes. Ivermectin, an avermectin derivative, is used as a treatment for parasitic infections in humans and domesticated animals.Discussion: Ivermectin's mechanism of action involves binding to ligand-gated ion channel receptors including glutamate, GABA, and glycine, resulting in parasitic paralysis and death. Due to varying expression of these ion channel receptors in vertebrate species, ivermectin toxicity is rarely reported in mammals. Ivermectin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein, which limits its neurological toxicity in humans. Genetic polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein or coadministration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors may increase the neurotoxicity of ivermectin. Other toxic effects of ivermectin after therapeutic oral use include edema, rash, headache, and ocular complaints. Most of these effects are mild and short in duration. Iverme...   \n",

              "6692  PURPOSE: Previous studies have outlined mechanisms by which Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumonia) infection may promote allergic lung inflammation and airway remodeling, and increasing evidence from human studies suggests that atypical bacterial infections contribute to asthma exacerbation, chronic asthma, and disease severity with changes in cytokine expression. The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), non-atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12).

On the other hand, the domain of animation faces has been studied less intensively due to the absence of a well-organized dataset. In this paper, we present a large-scale animation celebfaces dataset (AnimeCeleb) via controllable synthetic animation models to boost research on the animation face domain. To facilitate the data generation process, we build a semi-automatic pipeline based on an open 3D software and a developed annotation system. This leads to constructing a large-scale animation face dataset that includes multi-pose and multi-style animation faces with rich annotations. Experiments suggest that our dataset is applicable to various animation-related tasks such as head reenactment and colorization.   \n",

Unfortunately, practical transportation systems have dynamic, multi-attribute costs and the state-of-the-art technical approaches proposed in the literature are infeasible for practical deployment. In this paper, we offer a paradigm shift to selfish routing via characterizing idiosyncratic, multi-attribute costs at boundedly-rational travelers, as well as improving network efficiency using strategic information design. Specifically, we model the interaction between the system and travelers as a Stackelberg game, where travelers adopt multi-attribute logit responses. We model the strategic information design as an optimization problem, and develop a novel approximate algorithm to steer Logit Response travelers towards social welfare using strategic Information design . We demonstrate the performance of LoRI on a Wheatstone network with multi-modal route choices at the travelers. In our simulation experiments, we find that LoRI outperforms SSSP in terms of system utility, especially when there is a motive mismatch between the two systems and improves social welfare. For instance, we find that LoRI persuades a traveler towards a socially optimal route for 66.66% of the time on average, when compared to SSSP, when the system has 0.3 weight on carbon emissions. However, we also present a tradeoff between system performance and runtime in our simulation results.',\n",

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults ≥65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE: COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index , categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index  and continuous functional scale scored by physical  and occupational therapists . RESULTS: Among 73 admissions , mean  age was 83.5  and 42  were female, with mean FI of 0.31  with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days  for COVID-19 negative with 20  patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0  and 31  among patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty  had lower mBI scores on discharge , lower PT scores on discharge , and lower OT score on discharge . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Older adults admitted to a SNF for post-acute care with COVID-19 had community discharge rates and functional improvement comparable to a COVID-19 negative group. However, those who are frailer at admission tended to have lower function at discharge.',\n",

In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen using a novel TCR-binding algorithm. The predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and other common cold-causing coronaviruses. However, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells are likely to be present in many individuals because of prior exposure to flu and CMV viruses.',\n",

        "His death at an animal hospital on Friday was initially announced by veterinarian Dr. Karen Becker.\n",
        "She wrote on Facebook that “despite outliving every dog in history, his 11,478 days on earth would never be enough, for those who loved him.”\n",
        "There were many secrets to Bobi’s extraordinary old age, his owner Leonel Costa told GWR in February. He always roamed freely, without a leash or chain, lived in a “calm, peaceful” environment and ate human food soaked in water to remove seasonings, Costa said.\n",
        "He spent his whole life in Conqueiros, a small Portuguese village about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the capital Lisbon, often wandering around with cats.\n",
        "Bobi was a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo – a breed of livestock guardian dog – according to his owner. Rafeiro do Alentejos have a life expectancy of about 12-14 years, according to the American Kennel Club.\n",
        "But Bobi lived more than twice as long as that life expectancy, surpassing an almost century-old record to become the oldest living dog and the oldest dog ever – a title which had previously been held by Australian cattle-dog Bluey, who was born in 1910 and lived to be 29 years and five months old.\n",
        "However, Bobi’s story almost had a different ending.\n",
        "When he and his three siblings were born in the family’s woodshed, Costa’s father decided they already had too many animals at home.\n",
        "Costa and his brothers thought their parents had taken all the puppies away to be destroyed. However, a few sad days later, they found Bobi alive, safely hidden in a pile of logs.\n",
        "The children hid the puppy from their parents and, by the time Bobi’s existence became known, he was too old to be put down and went on to live his record-breaking life.\n",
        "His 31st birthday party in May was attended by more than 100 people and a performing dance troupe, GWR said.\n",
        "His eyesight deteriorated and walking became harder as Bobi grew older but he still spent time in the backyard with the cats, rested more and napped by the fire.\n",
        "“Bobi is special because looking at him is like remembering the people who were part of our family and unfortunately are no longer here, like my father, my brother, or my grandparents who have already left this world,” Costa told GWR in May. “Bobi represents those generations.”\n",
